      "text": "MUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nBetween\nAND\nSubject Matter:\nEffective Date of Agreement: Period , 2017\nfor Exchange of Information: , 2017 to\nPeriod of Confidentiality:\nTHIS AGREEMENT is made as of the Effective Date of Agreement noted above, by and between the above parties.\nBACKGROUND:\nI. The parties desire to have discussions of or relating to the Subject Matter for the purposes of evaluating a possible business relationship between them (\u201cPurpose\u201d). The parties may extend the Subject Matter or add additional parties by executing one or more addenda to this Agreement.\nII. Such discussions may involve disclosure by one party to the other party of confidential, proprietary or trade secret information of its own or its licensors (\u201cConfidential Information\u201d as defined below), during the Period for Exchange of Information.\nIII. Both parties recognize the value of the Confidential Information and that it is in their mutual best interests to maintain the confidential, proprietary and secret nature of the Confidential Information.\nTHEREFORE, in consideration of the Subject Matter, and the mutual promises herein, the parties agree as follows:\n1. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. The term \u201cConfidential Information\u201d as used herein means all nonpublic information relating to the Subject Matter that is disclosed by either party, its Affiliates (as defined below), or their agents (where applicable, collectively referred to as the \u201cDisclosing Party\u201d), directly or indirectly, in writing, orally or by inspection of premises or tangible objects to the other party (the \u201cRecipient\u201d) that is: (i) marked confidential or proprietary, or (ii) given the nature of the information or the circumstances surrounding its disclosure, reasonably should be deemed confidential. Confidential Information includes, but is not limited to documents, drawings, models, apparatus, sketches, designs, schedules, product plans, marketing plans, technical procedures, manufacturing processes, software, prototypes, samples, methodologies, formulations, trade secrets, patent applications, know-how, experimental results, specifications and other business information.\n2. PERIOD OF CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-USE. The Recipient will use Confidential Information only in connection with the Purpose as set forth in this Agreement. Recipient shall use the same degree of care to avoid disclosure or use of the Confidential Information as it uses for its own confidential, proprietary and trade secret information, but in no case use less than a reasonable degree of care. Recipient agrees to limit disclosure of Confidential Information to employees and employees of Affiliates having a specific need to know such Confidential Information for the Purpose and in the case of Affiliates only to the extent that such Affiliate is under obligation to hold such information in confidence and is made aware of these terms and conditions. Recipient will not disclose or permit access to Confidential Information to contract workers, consultants or contractors of Recipient or its Affiliates unless authorized by Disclosing Party in writing and on condition that such persons are bound by obligations of confidentiality inuring to the benefit of Disclosing Party and its Affiliates at least as restrictive as these terms and conditions. Recipient shall not without Disclosing Party\u2019s prior written consent reverse engineer, disassemble or decompile any prototypes, software or other objects which embody the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information to obtain access to Disclosing Party\u2019s trade secrets and to the extent such consent is granted Recipient shall receive and hold such Confidential Information subject to the terms of this Agreement.\n3. TERM. The term of this Agreement shall be for the Period of Exchange set forth above. Confidentiality obligations shall survive termination of this Agreement for the Period of Confidentiality set forth above unless the Confidential Information is a trade secret, in which case the confidentiality obligations shall continue for as long as the information is a trade secret. Either party may terminate this Agreement upon 30 days prior written notice.\n4. NOTICE OF UNAUTHORIZED USE. Recipient shall provide written notice to Disclosing Party without undue delay of any misuse or misappropriation of Confidential Information which may come to the attention of Recipient. The Recipient shall cooperate with and aid the Disclosing Party in mitigating and preventing the unauthorized use and disclosure and any furtherance thereof.\n5. EXCLUSIONS AND EXEMPTIONS. Recipient shall have no obligation of confidentiality with respect to any information which:\n5.1. is already known or in the possession of Recipient or its Affiliate at the time of disclosure as shown by the Recipient\u2019s and/or its Affiliates\u00b4 files and records prior to the time of disclosure, otherwise than as a result of any improper act or omission of Recipient or its Affiliate; or\n5.2. is or becomes public knowledge through no wrongful act of Recipient; or\n5.3. is rightfully acquired from others who did not obtain it under obligation of confidentiality; or\n5.4. is independently developed by an employee, agent or consultant of Recipient without reference to the Confidential Information; or\n5.5. is approved for release by written authorization from Disclosing Party.\n5.6. The Recipient is hereby notified that, as set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a71833(b), he/she does not have criminal or civil liability under U.S. trade secret law for the following disclosures of a trade secret:\n5.6.1. disclosure in confidence to a federal, state or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney, provided the disclosure is for the sole purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; and/or\n5.6.2. disclosure in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding if such filing is made under seal; and/or\n5.6.3. under those circumstances where Recipient files a lawsuit for retaliation against the Disclosing Party for reporting a suspected violation of law, Recipient may disclose the Disclosing Party\u2019s trade secret information to its attorney and may use the trade secret information in the court proceeding if Recipient files any document containing the trade secret under seal and does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.\n6. REPRODUCTION AND RETURN OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. The Confidential Information provided by the Disclosing Party shall not be copied or reproduced without the Disclosing Party\u2019s prior written permission, except for such copies as may reasonably be required for the purpose as set forth in Section I of this Agreement. Disclosing Party may serve written request on Recipient for return or destruction of its Confidential Information at any time up to six (6) months after the termination or expiry of this Agreement and Recipient shall, within thirty (30) days of such request or termination, return to the Disclosing Party (or its designees) or certify as destroyed all Confidential Information, in whatever form, including written or electronically recorded information and all copies thereof (other than copies retained in automatic back-up and archive systems), provided however that Recipient shall be entitled to retain one copy of the Confidential Information with its legal counsel or other appropriate corporate representative to evidence the exchange of information hereunder and in connection with legal or statutory requirements. All such retained copies shall remain subject to the use and disclosure restrictions in this Agreement.\n7. DISCLOSURES REQUIRED BY LAW. If Recipient is requested, ordered or required by a regulatory agency or any other government authority or a court to disclose any Confidential Information, Recipient shall promptly notify Disclosing Party of such request, order or requirement so that Disclosing Party may have the opportunity to contest the disclosure, including seeking a protective order, or waive Recipient\u2019s compliance with this Agreement. If Recipient is (in the opinion of its counsel) compelled to disclose any Confidential Information, or else be liable for contempt or other penalty or be subject to claims from a third party, Recipient may disclose such Confidential Information without liability under this Agreement.\n8. EXPORT LAWS. Neither party shall export, directly or indirectly, any of the Confidential Information to any country, person or entity which the US Government, at the time of export, requires an export license or other governmental approval without first obtaining such license or approval. The Recipient shall first obtain the written consent of Disclosing Party prior to submitting any request for authority to export such Confidential Information. For the purposes of this Agreement, export occurs when Confidential Information is transferred from one country to another by any means, including but not limited to physical shipments, FTP file transfers, e-mails, faxes, oral transfers or remote server access and an export may also occur when Confidential Information is transferred to or accessed by a person who is neither a citizen nor permanent resident of the country in which such transfer or access is taking place.\n9. OWNERSHIP OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. Disclosing Party or its licensors, as the case may be, retain all rights in Confidential Information disclosed and all documents, prototypes, software development kits (SDKs) and other similar tangible property embodying, containing or reflecting the same shall remain the property of Disclosing Party.\n10. NO LICENSE. Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the disclosure of any Confidential Information is construed as granting either expressly or by implication, estoppel or otherwise, any license or right to the Confidential Information or any intellectual property rights embodied therein.\n11. NO WARRANTY. All Confidential Information provided under this Agreement is provided \u201cAS IS\u201d and specifically excludes any warranty, whether express or implied, including without limitation, any implied warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or accuracy. The Disclosing Party is not liable under this Agreement for any damages in connection with, related to, or arising out of the use of its Confidential Information.\n12. NO OBLIGATION. This Agreement shall not be construed in any manner to be an obligation to enter into a further substantive contract or to disclose any particular Confidential Information.\n13. INDEPENDENT DEVELOPMENTS. Disclosing Party understands that Recipient may develop or have developed information internally, or receive or have received information from other parties that is similar to the Confidential Information. Accordingly, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as a representation that Recipient has not or will not independently develop products that compete with the products or systems contemplated by the Confidential Information provided that it does so without breaching the terms of this Agreement.\n14. RELATIONSHIP. Each party hereto shall be considered as an independent contractor responsible for its own expenses and financial obligations incurred in the performance of this Agreement.\n15. NO WAIVER. Neither party waives any rights in invention or development lawfully possessed by it at the time of signing this Agreement. In addition, this Agreement does not imply any waiver of any rights or action under the patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret, unfair competition, fair trade or related laws. Failure to exercise any rights under this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of such rights.\n16. INUREMENT. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective \u201cAffiliates\u201d (as defined below), successors, assigns and legal representatives. The parties agree that each party and its Affiliates may receive Confidential Information from and/or disclose Confidential Information to the other party and the other party's Affiliates, and that all such Confidential Information shall be governed by this Agreement. Recipient shall be fully responsible to the Disclosing Party for any breach of this Agreement by the Recipient\u2019s Affiliates. \u201cAffiliate\u201d, as used herein, means an entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with a party to this Agreement; and as used in this Section \u201dcontrol\u201d, \u201ccontrols\u201d or \u201dcontrolled\u201d means: (i) fifty-one percent (51%) or more ownership or beneficial interest of income or capital of such entity; (ii) ownership of at least fifty-one percent (51%) of the voting power or voting equity; or (iii) the ability to otherwise direct or share management policies of such entity.\n17. INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. The parties agree that any use of Confidential Information in violation of this Agreement may cause the other party irreparable harm, and may leave it with no adequate remedy at law and shall, thereby, entitle it to seek injunctive relief in any court with competent jurisdiction over the party or party\u2019s Affiliate in violation.\n18. CHOICE OF LAW. This Agreement is governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Michigan, without regard to principles of conflict or choice of laws. The Parties hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts of the State of Michigan.\n19. SURVIVAL. Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 17, 18, 19 and any sections (or parts thereof) which, by their nature, are intended to survive termination shall survive termination of this Agreement.\n20. SEVERABILITY. If a court finds any provision of this Agreement or any right or obligation invalid or unenforceable, this Agreement shall be immediately deemed amended to: (i) include a provision that reflects the intent of the parties, or, if (i) is not possible, (ii) to exclude such provision and the parties shall negotiate in good faith a substitute provision that reflect the parties\u2019 intent at the time of entering into the Agreement.\n21. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement contains the entire understanding between the parties regarding the Confidential Information and supersedes all other communications, reports or understandings between the parties in respect thereto. No change or addition to any provision shall be binding unless it is in writing and signed by an authorized representative of both parties. All notices shall be in writing and delivered by electronic mail, registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) to the appropriate address set forth in the signature block below.\n22. HEADINGS. Headings in this Agreement are for reference only and shall not affect the meaning of the provisions.\n23. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be signed in two or more counterparts including signing facsimile copies. Each counterpart is deemed an original and all counterparts together shall constitute one and the same instrument.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused their authorized representatives to execute this Agreement as of the date first written above.\nSignature: Signature:\nPrint Name: Print Name:\nTitle: Title:\nDate: Date:\nSignature:\nPrint Name:\nTitle:\nDate\n",

The Disclosee will procure that prior to the disclosure to any other person (including any professional advisor) of any Confidential Information, such other person is made aware of the provisions of this Agreement and the fact that the Disclosee will be liable.\nThe Disclosee acknowledges that the Confidential Information, in as far as it relates to bpost SA/NV, could be price sensitive information and ensures compliance with the relevant legal and other provisions in this respect (including, without being limited to, the provisions of the Belgian Law of 2 August 2002 on the supervision of the financial sector and on the financial services in relation to insider dealing and market manipulation). Confidential Information shall mean the following:\na) all such information, of any kind whatsoever (whether in oral, written or electronic form, and including, but not limited to, technical, commercial, financial, accounting, legal and administrative information) pertaining to the Sale of the Munt and the Sellers as may be provided to the Disclosee and their responsible managers, officers, employees, shareholders, members of the Board of Directors and advisors (including financial, legal and tax advisors and auditors) (\u201cRepresentatives\u201d), by the Sellers, their advisors or their representatives;\nb) all such analyses, compilations, forecasts, notes, memoranda and other documents as the Sellers or Deloitte Real Estate* and Laga** (the \u201cAdvisors\u201d) may have prepared or caused to be prepared and which may contain, refer to or simply result from, the information mentioned in point (a) above;\nc) the fact that the Disclosee (or any of their Representatives) are or have been involved in the analysis of, in meetings or negotiations related to the Sale, the contents, time and status of such negotiations, and generally any fact concerning the Sale.\nConfidential Information shall exclude:\na) information which had become available to the public prior to the date of disclosure thereof to the Disclosee or their Representatives, or that became available to the public after such date other than as a result of a breach of this Agreement by the Disclosee or their Representatives;\nb) information which was lawfully in the Disclosee\u2019s possession or in the possession of one or more of their Representatives prior to disclosure under this Agreement, in each case on a non-confidential basis, which, to their knowledge was free of any restriction as to its use or disclosure.\nThe Disclosee acknowledges that they may not approach the representatives of the Sellers and cannot contact anybody else other than the contact persons from the Advisors.\nThe Disclosee further undertakes and acknowledges, that neither the representatives of the Sellers nor their Advisors give any warranty or make any representation as to the accuracy or completeness of any of the Confidential Information or as to the reasonableness of any assumptions on which the information is based. The Disclosee agrees that the Sellers or Advisors shall not have any liability to the Disclosee or to any of their directors, employees, advisors or agents resulting from the use of Confidential Information.\nThis Agreement shall in no way constitute a commitment by any person to supply any Confidential Information or enter into any contract in connection with the Sellers. The obligations of the Disclosee under this Agreement shall expire the earlier of (a) three years after the date of this Agreement, or (b) the date the Sale between the Candidate and the Sellers is completed. The obligations of confidentiality and non-disclosure under this Agreement shall become effective as of the date of signing.\nIn the event that the Disclosee or any of its Representatives becomes legally compelled to disclose any of the Confidential Information to a regulatory authority or to any other entity or third party, the Disclosee shall immediately notify the Sellers before disclosing such Confidential Information, so that the Sellers may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy, without prejudice to the Disclosee\u2019s remedies under this Agreement.\nIt is further understood and agreed that, without prejudice to any other rights or remedies which either party may have, any breach of these undertakings could cause the Sellers and/or its shareholders irreparable injury. In the event of an actual or threatened breach by the Disclosee and/or its Representatives of any provisions of this Agreement, the Sellers shall be entitled (i) to seek injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction restraining the Disclosee and/or its Representatives from breaching the terms hereof or from disclosing any Confidential Information to any person and (ii) specific performance and other equitable relief.\nThis Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with Belgian law and the Parties irrevocably agree to submit themselves to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of Brussels.

In the event this Agreement is terminated, and the Disclosing Party so requests, the Receiving Party shall promptly return or destroy (and certify destruction of) all Confidential Information which it received from the Disclosing Party along with all copies. The obligations of the Receiving Party under this Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement or the return of the Confidential Information to the Disclosing Party.\n10. The Parties acknowledge and understand that all documentation and information, including Confidential Information, provided to the Province of Nova Scotia or HRM, as the case may be, pursuant to this Agreement shall be kept confidential, subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, Province of Nova Scotia, and such other laws of the Province of Nova Scotia and Canada which may apply from time to time.\n11.

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement, written or verbal, between the parties with respect to the terms set forth herein.

      "text": "NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nTHIS NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (\u201cAgreement\u201d) made this ___________day of _________________, ________________ (\u201cEffective Date\u201d), by and between VIDAR Systems Corporation, a Virginia corporation, with offices in Herndon, Virginia (\u201cVIDAR\u201d), and _________________________________, a _____________________ [corporation/limited liability company/individual], whose address is ______________________________________________________ (\u201cReceiver\u201d).\nWHEREAS, in the course of its activities with VIDAR, Receiver will receive confidential information about VIDAR, including but not limited to VIDAR\u2019s products (hardware, software and firmware) and its design, engineering, research, development, software, marketing, manufacturing processes, pricing and business plans. Receiver has agreed to receive such information on a confidential basis and to disclose it only as provided for in this Agreement.\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants contained herein, and of other good and valid consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:\n1. Confidential Information. The term \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means any and all tangible and intangible information disclosed to Receiver in oral, written, graphic, recorded, photographic, any machine-readable or in any other medium or form relating to the intellectual property, management, operations, products, inventions, suppliers, customers, financials of VIDAR or any present or contemplated project, contract or relationship between VIDAR and Receiver, including without limitation, any and all plans, Intellectual Property (defined below), know-how, computer programs, software (source and object code), algorithms, computer processing systems, techniques, methodologies, formulae, compilations of information, designs, drawings, schematics, analyses, evaluations, formulations, ingredients, samples, processes, machines, prototypes, mock-ups, product performance data, proposals, job notes, reports, records, specifications, manuals, supplier and customer lists and information, licenses, the prices it obtains or has obtained for the licensing of its software products and services, purchase and sales records, marketing information or any other information concerning the business and goodwill of VIDAR and any information which is identified as being of a confidential or proprietary nature or should be considered confidential under the circumstances.\n2. Receiver\u2019s Obligations. Receiver shall: (i) hold the Confidential Information in strict confidence; (ii) use the Confidential Information only for the purposes as expressly directed by VIDAR; and (iii) provide such information only to those of its personnel who: (y) have a need to know the same to further VIDAR\u2019s interests; and (z) become a party to and bound by a confidentiality agreement at least as restrictive as this Agreement prior to receiving any such information. Receiver will not disclose Confidential Information to any party who do not meet the preceding requirements. Receiver shall use the same degree of care to protect and safeguard the confidentiality of Confidential Information as it uses to protect and safeguard the confidentiality of its own proprietary information, and Receiver represents, warrants and covenants to VIDAR that such degree of care is reasonably designed to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information.\n3. Additional Disclosures. Receiver may disclose Confidential Information if the same:\n(a) was generally available at the time it was disclosed other than as a result of a disclosure made by Receiver;\n(b) was known to the Receiver at the time it received such information, as evidenced by contemporaneous documentation in Receiver\u2019s files;\n(c) is disclosed with the prior written approval of VIDAR;\n(d) becomes known to Receiver on a non-confidential basis from a source other than VIDAR without breach of this Agreement by Receiver;\n(e) is disclosed to a third party by VIDAR without restrictions against non-disclosure similar to those contained in this Agreement;\n(f) is disclosed pursuant to the order or requirement of a court; administrative agency, or other government body, provided Receiver takes all reasonable steps to keep the Confidential Information from becoming part of public records; or\n(g) is hereafter independently developed by Receiver without the aid, application or use of any Confidential Information;\nprovided for each that: (i) Receiver promptly notifies VIDAR of such action; and (ii) in any action to enforce or remedy a breach of this Agreement, Receiver shall have the burden of establishing the applicability of the subsection on which it relies.\n4. Additional Receivers. An employee, director, officer, manager, member, partner, affiliate, associate, agent, attorney, accountant, consultant, banker, business adviser, financial adviser, scientific adviser or technical adviser of Receiver may become a party to this Agreement by signing a counterpart hereof, a copy of which shall be provided to VIDAR within five days of signature.\n5. Intellectual Property\n(a) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as granting or conferring any rights, interests or intellectual property rights by assignment, license or otherwise, relating to any Confidential Information in or for any intellectual property, invention, discovery or improvement or derivative made, conceived or acquired prior or subsequent to the Effective Date. Except for the limited right to use the Confidential Information as set forth above, all intellectual property, patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and all other rights and interests in the Confidential Information and the products, inventions, ideas, works, creation, symbols, data, reports, opinions and all other concepts and materials developed, invented, reduced to practice, authored or created by Receiver (including portions and derivatives thereof) in any medium arising from or relating to this Agreement (\u201cIntellectual Property\u201d) shall be the sole and exclusive property of VIDAR.\n(b) All Intellectual Property that are original works of authorship shall be considered works made for hire (as that phrase is used in Section 101 of the United States Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 or analogous law). If any Intellectual Property is found not to be a work made for hire and/or is owned by Receiver or any third party, Receiver hereby irrevocably (and shall cause any third party owner to) assigns and transfers all rights to and interests in such Intellectual Property to VIDAR without further consideration.\n(c) Receiver shall promptly disclose all Intellectual Property to VIDAR and shall make and maintain adequate and current written records of all Intellectual Property. Receiver agrees to take all actions, execute all instruments and fully cooperate with VIDAR, its successors, assigns or nominees in which, in the opinion of VIDAR, are expedient or necessary at any time to file, prosecute, register, evidence, secure, maintain or litigate all such VIDAR rights and interests in the Intellectual Property throughout the world, including all commercial, legal or administrative proceedings involving the same. All expenses of applying for and obtaining such rights and interests shall be borne by VIDAR. VIDAR shall reimburse Receiver for pre-approved expenses paid in connection with such cooperation.\n6. Return of Confidential Information. Upon the request of VIDAR or the termination or expiration of this Confidential Agreement, Receiver shall promptly return to VIDAR all copies of the Confidential Information and obtained by Receiver.\n7. Disclaimer. Receiver acknowledges that the Confidential Information may relate to processes or products that are developmental and may or may not have been reduced to practical application in prototype form. Accordingly, Receiver understands that neither VIDAR has made or makes any representation or warranty as to the accuracy, completeness or value of the Confidential Information. RECEIVER AGREES THAT NEITHER VIDAR NOR ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO RECEIVER OR ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES RESULTING FROM RECEIVER\u2019S ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.\n8. Injunction. Receiver acknowledges and agrees that: (i) the Confidential Information is proprietary to and valuable information of VIDAR; (ii) VIDAR derives economic value from the Confidential Information not being generally known to other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; (iii) any disclosure or unauthorized use of the Confidential Information could cause irreparable harm and loss to VIDAR; and (iv) if this Agreement is breached, VIDAR can not be made whole by monetary damages. Accordingly, VIDAR, in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled by law or in equity, shall be entitled to an injunction to prevent further breaches of this Agreement and to an order compelling specific performance of this Agreement. Receiver shall reimburse VIDAR for all costs and expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees, incurred by VIDAR in enforcing the obligations of Receiver.\n9. General. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia and all actions involving this Agreement shall be brought in the state or federal courts located in the Commonwealth of Virginia, to which the parties consent to jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties, their legal representatives, successors and assigns. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, neither this Agreement, nor any rights granted hereunder may be assigned, transferred, conveyed or encumbered, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, by Receiver without the prior written consent of VIDAR (which may be granted or withheld in VIDAR\u2019s sole and absolute judgment), and any attempt to do so will be deemed null and void. This Agreement becomes effective on the Effective Date and continues in effect thereafter for so long as any Confidential Information continues to exist. VIDAR may terminate this Agreement at any time for any reason. Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited, unenforceable or not authorized in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition, unenforceability or non-authorization without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof or affecting the validity, enforceability or legality of such provision in any other jurisdiction. This Agreement contains the entire understanding and agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter contained herein, supersedes all prior oral or written understandings and agreements relating thereto, except as expressly otherwise provided, and may not be altered, modified or waived in whole or in part, except in writing, signed by duly authorized representatives of the parties hereto. The failure of either party to insist upon the performance of any of the terms, covenants, conditions or provisions of this Agreement shall not be considered a waiver or relinquishment of future compliance therewith; nor shall a waiver by either party of any breach or any term, covenant, condition, agreement or provision, operate as a waiver of any other term, covenant condition, agreement or provision. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which when taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been executed by the following duly authorized representatives of the parties:\nVIDAR SYSTEMS CORPORATION RECEIVER\nBy: _____________________________ By: _____________________________\n Signature Signature\nPrint: _____________________________ Print: _____________________________\nTitle: _____________________________ Title: _____________________________\nDate: _____________________________ Date: _____________________________\n",

This entails the disclosure of Confidential Information.\n2.4 The Parties wish to record the terms and conditions upon which each shall disclose Confidential Information to the other, which terms and conditions shall constitute a binding and enforceable Agreement between the Parties and their agents.\n2.5 This Agreement shall also bind the Parties, notwithstanding the Signature Date, in the event that either Party shall have disclosed any Confidential Information to the other Party prior to the Signature Date.\n3 DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\n3.1 The Disclosing Party shall only disclose the Confidential Information to the Receiving Party to the extent deemed necessary or desirable by the Disclosing Party in its sole discretion.\n3.2 The Receiving Party acknowledges that the Confidential Information is a valuable, special and unique asset proprietary to the Disclosing Party.\n3.3 The Receiving Party agrees that it will, during or after the course of their relationship and/or the term of this Agreement as described in clause 9, keep the Confidential Information in the strictest confidence and will not disclose it to any third party for any reason or purpose whatsoever without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party, save in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, and the Parties undertake to each other that their holding and subsidiary companies or agents shall be bound by the provisions of this Agreement. For avoidance of doubt, in this Agreement \u201cthird party\u201d means any party other than Client and AfriGIS and their holding and subsidiary companies or agents.\n3.4 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement the Parties agree that the Confidential Information may be disclosed by the Receiving Party to its professional advisors on a need-to-know basis; provided that that Party takes whatever steps are necessary to procure that such professional advisors agree to abide by the terms of this Agreement to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of the Confidential Information to third parties.

and\n5.3 in accordance with applicable data privacy legislation, as amended from time to time.\n6 STANDARD OF CARE\nThe Receiving Party agrees that it shall protect the Confidential Information disclosed to or obtained by it by using the same standard of care that the Receiving Party applies to safeguard its own proprietary, secret or Confidential Information and that the information shall be stored and handled in such a way as to prevent any unauthorised disclosure thereof.\n7 RETURN OF MATERIAL CONTAINING OR PERTAINING TO THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\n7.1 The Disclosing Party may, at any time, request the Receiving Party to return any material containing, pertaining to or relating to the Confidential Information and may, in addition request the Receiving Party to furnish a written statement to the effect that, upon such return, the Receiving Party has not retained in its possession, or under its control, either directly or indirectly, any such material.\n7.2 As an alternative to the return of the material contemplated in clause 7.1, the Receiving Party shall, at the instance of the Disclosing Party, destroy such material and furnish the Disclosing Party with a written statement from authorised officers to the effect that all such material has been destroyed.\n7.3 The Receiving Party shall comply with a request in terms of this clause, within 14 (fourteen) calendar days of receipt of such a request.\n8 EXCLUDED CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\nThe obligations of the Receiving Party pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement shall not apply to any Confidential Information that \u2013\n8.1 is or was known to, or in the possession of the Receiving Party prior to disclosure thereof by the Disclosing Party;\n8.2 is or becomes publicly known, otherwise than as a result of a breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party;\n8.3 is developed independently of the Disclosing Party by the Receiving Party in circumstances that do not amount to a breach of the provisions of this Agreement;\n8.4 is disclosed by the Receiving Party to satisfy an order of a court of competent jurisdiction or to comply with the provisions of any law or regulation in force from time to time;

In connection with any transaction entered or contemplated to be entered pursuant to the Borrowing Agreement, Lending Agent shall provide to the Borrower information regarding each Principal, including the Name, Tax or Government ID, address, and other specific identifying information, financial information, corporate structure and organization, and/or information concerning Loans entered into on behalf of specific Principals (collectively, the \u201cInformation\u201d).\n2. Borrower shall use the Information solely in its credit, risk management and net capital processes, including, without limitation, functions such as concentration limit monitoring, compliance or legal review, or senior management oversight as Borrower may reasonably deem necessary to comply with regulatory requirements including, without limitation, regulatory capital computation, regulatory reporting and concentration limit monitoring.\n3. Borrower shall limit the distribution of the Information within the firm to only those credit, risk management, regulatory reporting and compliance areas who perform the functions described above. In particular, Borrower shall not permit the trading desks within the firm to have access to the Information, except and only to the extent that such trading desks are involved in the ordinary course of business in risk management functions. Borrower may also disclose the Information to its legal counsel.\n4. Borrower shall maintain the Information in confidence and shall not disclose the information to any third party without the consent of Lending Agent; provided, however, that Borrower may disclose the Information to the extent required by subpoena, court order, request from a regulatory body with jurisdiction over Borrower, or as otherwise required by law or regulation. Borrower shall not be required to keep the Information confidential to the extent that the Information (a) becomes publicly known through means other than a breach of this Agreement by Borrower; (b) was in the possession of Borrower prior to receipt thereof from the Lending Agent; or (c) is independently learned, obtained or developed by Borrower without violating the terms of this Agreement.\n5. If Borrower (or its employees or agents) breaches or threatens to breach this Agreement, Lending Agent may, in addition to any other remedies available, seek any equitable remedy it deems appropriate to enjoin an actual or threatened violation by Borrower.\n6. Borrower acknowledges that, except with respect to information regarding loans entered into on behalf of specific Principals, Lending Agent did not create or compile the Information and is merely forwarding information obtained from Principals. Accordingly, Borrower acknowledges that Lending Agent makes no representations or warranties regarding the accuracy or completeness of the Information and that Borrower is not relying on Lending Agent to have performed any review of the Information for accuracy or completeness.\n7. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Borrower and Lending Agent hereby hereby irrevocably waive any and all rights to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between the parties and supersedes any and all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended except by a writing signed by both parties hereto.\n8. This Agreement shall be effective as of the date set forth above. The obligations hereunder shall expire upon the earlier to occur of (a) ___ years from the termination date of the last loan of securities outstanding under the Borrowing Agreement or (b) the date upon which the Information ceases to be confidential as set forth above.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Agreement to be duly executed by their respective authorized representatives as of the day and year first above written.\n________________ _______________________\n[BORROWER] [LENDING AGENT]\nBy: ____________________________ By: _____________________________\nName: __________________________ Name: __________________________\nTitle: ___________________________ Title: ___________________________\n",

Term and Termination\n6.1 If either Party decides not to become, or continue to be involved in the Purpose it shall notify the other Party in writing immediately. The obligations of each Party shall, notwithstanding any earlier termination of negotiations or discussions between the Parties in relation to the Purpose, continue for a period of five (5) years from the termination of this Agreement.\n6.2 Termination of this Agreement shall not affect any accrued rights or remedies to which either Party is entitled.\n7. Remedies\nWithout prejudice to any other rights or remedies that any Party may have, the Recipient Party acknowledges and agrees that damages alone would not be an adequate remedy for any breach by the Recipient Party of the provisions of this Agreement, and that the remedies of injunction and specific performance as well an any other equitable relief for any threatened or actual breach by the Recipient Party or its Representatives would be more appropriate remedies.\n8. Entire Agreement and Variation\n8.1 This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes and extinguishes all previous drafts, agreements, arrangements and understandings between them, whether written or oral, relating to its subject matter.\n8.2 No variation of this Agreement shall be effective unless it is in writing and signed by each of the Parties (or their authorised representatives).\n9. No Waiver\n9.1 Failure by either Party to enforce any of its rights under this Agreement shall not be taken as or deemed to be a waiver of such.\n9.2 No waiver or amendment of any provisions of this Agreement shall be valid or binding against either Party unless the waiver or amendment is made in writing and signed by the duly appointed representatives of both Parties.\n10. Assignment\nThis Agreement is personal to the Parties and shall not be assigned or otherwise transferred in whole or in part by either Party without the prior written consent of the other Party.\n11. Notices\nAny notice required to be given under this Agreement, shall be in writing and shall be delivered personally, or sent by pre-paid first class post or recorded delivery or by commercial courier, to each Party required to receive the notice at its address as set out above or as otherwise specified by the relevant Party by notice in writing to each other Party.\n12. No Partnership\nNothing in this Agreement is intended to, or shall be deemed to, establish any partnership or joint venture between any of the Parties, constitute any party the agent of another party, nor authorise any Party to make or enter into any commitments for or on behalf of any other Party.\n13. Third Party Rights\nA person who is not a Party to this Agreement shall not have any rights under or in connection with it.\n14.

The data and information that State expects to provide to Recipient for use in evaluating Recipient's proposal to provide the Services is confidential and not public data and the parties desire to enter into a Confidentiality Agreement to set forth their respective duties and obligations regarding State's data and information.\nProvisions\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing Background Information, which is incorporated by this reference as if fully re-written herein and the mutual covenants and provisions set forth herein, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:\nSection 1. Confidential Information. As used in this Agreement, \"Confidential Information\" shall mean any and all technical and non-technical information about State, including, but not limited to data and information processed by State in connection with evaluating the Services. The term shall also include all \"protected health information\" (as defined by 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 160.103) and any other personally identifiable information (\"PII\") regarding any individual who is, or may become, eligible for the State's Plan (including, but not limited to, such Plan's travel benefit). The Recipient hereby agrees to abide by State's determination that such information is Confidential Information and that the same is of a special and unique nature and value, important and material, that it gravely affects the effective and successful conduct of the business and that it may include personal identification information or other information of State or State employees and their dependents that is to be maintained as confidential.\nSection 2. Preservation of Confidentiality. All Confidential Information (a) supplied by any employee, agent, consultant, or independent contractor of State (\"State Representatives\") to the Recipient or any employee, agent, officer, director, shareholder, independent contractor or representative of the Recipient (collectively, the \"Recipient Representatives\"), (b) obtained by the Recipient or any Recipient Representatives from any documents, meetings or telephone conversations with any State Representatives or from books or records of State, (c) obtained by the Recipient or any Recipient Representatives or in any other manner including through hosting the software evaluation on Recipient's website, or (d) jointly or individually developed by State and/or Recipient shall be protected and maintained by the Recipient on a confidential basis and the Recipient shall not use any of the Confidential Information for any purposes (other than as permitted by this Agreement). The Recipient shall refrain from directly or indirectly disclosing any of the Confidential Information to any person, firm, fund, or entity, or knowingly making any Confidential Information available to any others for any use (other than as permitted by this Agreement).

      "text": "Attachment I. Non-Disclosure Agreement (Contractor)\nTHIS NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (\u201cAgreement\u201d) is made by and between the State of Maryland (the \u201cState\u201d), acting by and through _______________________________________ (Issuing Agency Name) (the \u201cDepartment\u201d or \u201cAgency\u201d or \u201cAuthority\u201d or \u201cCommission\u201d), and _____________________________________________ (the \u201cContractor\u201d).\nRECITALS\nWHEREAS, the Contractor has been awarded a contract (the \u201cContract\u201d) following the solicitation for ________________________________________________________ (Solicitation Title) Solicitation # ____________________; and\nWHEREAS, in order for the Contractor to perform the work required under the Contract, it will be necessary for the State at times to provide the Contractor and the Contractor\u2019s employees, agents, and subcontractors (collectively the \u201cContractor\u2019s Personnel\u201d) with access to certain information the State deems confidential information (the \u201cConfidential Information\u201d).\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of being given access to the Confidential Information in connection with the solicitation and the Contract, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which the parties acknowledge, the parties do hereby agree as follows:\n1. Regardless of the form, format, or media on or in which the Confidential Information is provided and regardless of whether any such Confidential Information is marked as such, \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means (1) any and all information provided by or made available by the State to the Contractor in connection with the Contract and (2) any and all personally identifiable information (PII) (including but not limited to personal information as defined in Md. Ann. Code, General Provisions \u00a74-101(h) and Md. Ann. Code, State Govt. \u00a7 10-1301(c)) and protected health information (PHI) as defined in 45 CFR 160.103 that is provided by a person or entity to the Contractor in connection with this Contract. Confidential Information includes, by way of example only, information that the Contractor views, takes notes from, copies (if the State agrees in writing to permit copying), possesses or is otherwise provided access to and use of by the State in relation to the Contract.\n2. The Contractor shall not, without the State\u2019s prior written consent, copy, disclose, publish, release, transfer, disseminate, use, or allow access for any purpose or in any form, any Confidential Information except for the sole and exclusive purpose of performing under the Contract. The Contractor shall limit access to the Confidential Information to the Contractor\u2019s Personnel who have a demonstrable need to know such Confidential Information in order to perform under the Contract and who are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those set forth in this Agreement. Contractor shall provide copies of such agreements to the State. The names of such personnel are attached hereto and made a part hereof as Attachment I-2. Contractor shall update Attachment I-2 by adding additional names (whether Contractor\u2019s Personnel or a subcontractor\u2019s personnel) as needed, from time to time.\n3. If the Contractor intends to disseminate any portion of the Confidential Information to non-employee agents who are assisting in the Contractor\u2019s performance of the Contract or will otherwise have a role in performing any aspect of the Contract, the Contractor shall first obtain the written consent of the State to any such dissemination. The State may grant, deny, or condition any such consent, as it may deem appropriate in its sole and absolute subjective discretion.\n4. The Contractor hereby agrees to hold the Confidential Information in trust and in strictest confidence, adopt or establish operating procedures and physical security measures, and take all other measures necessary to protect the Confidential Information from inadvertent release or disclosure to unauthorized third parties and to prevent all or any portion of the Confidential Information from falling into the public domain or into the possession of persons not bound to maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information.\n5. The Contractor shall promptly advise the State in writing if it learns of any unauthorized use, misappropriation, or disclosure of the Confidential Information by any of the Contractor\u2019s Personnel or the Contractor\u2019s former Personnel. Contractor shall, at its own expense, cooperate with the State in seeking injunctive or other equitable relief against any such person(s).\n6. The Contractor shall, at its own expense, return to the State all Confidential Information in its care, custody, control or possession upon request of the State or on termination of the Contract.\n7. A breach of this Agreement by the Contractor or the Contractor\u2019s Personnel shall constitute a breach of the Contract between the Contractor and the State.\n8. Contractor acknowledges that any failure by the Contractor or the Contractor\u2019s Personnel to abide by the terms and conditions of use of the Confidential Information may cause irreparable harm to the State and that monetary damages may be inadequate to compensate the State for such breach. Accordingly, the Contractor agrees that the State may obtain an injunction to prevent the disclosure, copying or improper use of the Confidential Information. The Contractor consents to personal jurisdiction in the Maryland State Courts. The State\u2019s rights and remedies hereunder are cumulative and the State expressly reserves any and all rights, remedies, claims and actions that it may have now or in the future to protect the Confidential Information and seek damages from the Contractor and the Contractor\u2019s Personnel for a failure to comply with the requirements of this Agreement. In the event the State suffers any losses, damages, liabilities, expenses, or costs (including, by way of example only, attorneys\u2019 fees and disbursements) that are attributable, in whole or in part to any failure by the Contractor or any of the Contractor\u2019s Personnel to comply with the requirements of this Agreement, the Contractor shall hold harmless and indemnify the State from and against any such losses, damages, liabilities, expenses, and costs.\n9. The parties further agree that:\na. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Maryland;\nb. The rights and obligations of the Contractor under this Agreement may not be assigned or delegated, by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the State;\nc. The State makes no representations or warranties as to the accuracy or completeness of any Confidential Information;\nd. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement;\ne. Signatures exchanged by facsimile are effective for all purposes hereunder to the same extent as original signatures;\nf. The Recitals are not merely prefatory but are an integral part hereof; and\ng. The effective date of this Agreement shall be the same as the effective date of the Agreement entered into by the parties.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have, by their duly authorized representatives, executed this Agreement as of the day and year first above written.\nContractor: Department\nBy: By:\n(seal)\nPrinted Name:\nPrinted Name:\nTitle: Title:\nDate: Date:\nI-2 NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nLIST OF CONTRACTOR\u2019S EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS WHO WILL BE GIVEN ACCESS TO THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\nPrinted Name and Employee (E) Signature Date\nAddress of\nIndividual/Agent or Agent (A)\n_______________________ __________ ____________________________ _________\n_______________________ __________ ____________________________ _________\n_______________________ __________ ____________________________ _________\n_______________________ __________ ____________________________ _________\n_______________________ __________ ____________________________ _________\n_______________________ __________ ____________________________ _________\n_______________________ __________ ____________________________ _________\n_______________________ __________ ____________________________ _________\n_______________________ __________ ____________________________ _________\n_______________________ __________ ____________________________ _________\n_______________________ __________ ____________________________ _________\n_______________________ __________ ____________________________ _________\n_______________________ __________ ____________________________ _________\n_______________________ __________ ____________________________ _________\n_______________________ __________ ____________________________ _________\n_______________________ __________ ____________________________ _________\n_______________________ __________ ____________________________ _________\n_______________________ __________ ____________________________ _________\n_______________________ __________ ____________________________ _________\n_______________________ __________ ____________________________ _________\n_______________________ __________ ____________________________ _________\n_______________________ __________ ____________________________ _________\nI-3 NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nCERTIFICATION TO ACCOMPANY RETURN OR DELETION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\nI AFFIRM THAT:\nTo the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, and upon due inquiry, I hereby certify that: (i) all Confidential Information which is the subject matter of that certain Non-Disclosure Agreement by and between the State of Maryland and __________________________ (\u201cContractor\u201d) dated __________________, 20_____ (\u201cAgreement\u201d) is attached hereto and is hereby returned to the State in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Agreement; and (ii) I am legally authorized to bind the Contractor to this affirmation.

Confidential information.\na. What is included, \"Confidential information\" is non-public information, know-how and trade secrets in any form that:\n\uf0b7 Are designated as \"confidential\"; or\n\uf0b7 A reasonable person knows or reasonably should understand to be confidential.\nb. What is not included? The following types of information, however marked, are not confidential information. Information that:\n\uf0b7 Is, or becomes, publicly available without a breach of this agreement;\n\uf0b7 Was lawfully known to the receiver of the information without an obligation to keep it confidential;\n\uf0b7 Is received from another source who can disclose it lawfully and without an obligation to keep it confidential;\n\uf0b7 Is independently developed; or\n\uf0b7 Is a comment or suggestion one of us volunteers about the other's business, products or services.\n3. Treatment of confidential information.\na. In general. Subject to the other terms of this agreement, each of us agrees:\n\uf0b7 We will not disclose the other's confidential information to third parties; and\n\uf0b7 We will use and disclose the other's confidential information only for purposes of our business relationship with each other.\nb. Security precautions. Each of us agrees:\n\uf0b7 To take reasonable steps to protect the other's confidential information. These steps must be at least as protective as those we take to protect our own confidential information;\n\uf0b7 To notify the other promptly upon discovery of any unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information; and\n\uf0b7 To cooperate with the other to help regain control of the confidential information and prevent further unauthorized use or disclosure of it.\nc. Sharing confidential information with affiliates and representatives.\n\uf0b7 A \"representative\" is an employee, contractor, advisor or consultant of one of us or one of our respective affiliates.\n\uf0b7 Each of us may disclose the other's confidential information to our representatives (who may then disclose that confidential information to other of our representatives) only if those representatives have a need to know about it for purposes of our business relationship with each other. Before doing so, each of us must:\no Ensure that affiliates and representatives are required to protect the confidential information on terms consistent with this agreement; and\no Accept responsibility for each representative's use of confidential information.\n\uf0b7 Neither of us is required to restrict work assignments of representatives who have had access to confidential information. Neither of us can control the incoming information the other will disclose to us in the course of working together, or what our representatives will remember, even without notes or other aids. We agree that use of information in representatives' unaided memories in the development or deployment of our respective products or services does not create liability under this agreement or trade secret law, and we agree to limit what we disclose to the other accordingly.\nd. Disclosing confidential information if required to by law. Each of us may disclose the other's confidential information if required to comply with a court order or other government demand that has the force of law. Before doing so, each of us must seek the highest level of protection available and, when possible, give the other enough prior notice to provide a reasonable chance to seek a protective order.\n4. Length of confidential information obligations\na. Termination. This agreement continues in effect until one of us terminates it. Either of us may terminate this agreement for any reason by providing the other with 60 days' advance written notice. Termination of this agreement will not change any of the rights and duties made while this agreement is in effect.\nb. No other use or disclosure of confidential information. Except as permitted above, neither of us will use nor disclose the other's confidential information for three years after we receive it. The three-year\nc. time period does not apply if applicable law requires a longer period.\n5. General rights, obligations and miscellaneous.\na. Law that applies; jurisdiction and venue. The laws of the State of Florida govern this agreement. If federal jurisdiction exists, we each consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal courts in Broward County, Florida.

Conversely, BCG agrees not to solicit business services from any of Partner\u2019s customers where Partner has engaged BCG on any such customer work orders and where Partner has introduced BCG to such customer(s).\nc. Non-solicitation- Employees. During the term of the agreement and for a period of twelve (12) months thereafter, each party agrees not to solicit or recruit any employee of each other without the prior written consent of that party. Both BCG and Partner hereby agree that it will not solicit for hire, in any capacity whatsoever, any of each other\u2019s employees, contractors or other such affiliated resources without prior written consent from the other party.\nd. Compliance with law. Parties will comply with all laws regarding confidential information.\ne. Waiver. Any delay or failure of either of us to exercise a right or remedy will not result in a waiver of that, or any other, right or remedy.\nf. Money damages insufficient. Each of us acknowledges that money damages may not be sufficient compensation for a breach of this agreement. Each of us agrees that the other may seek court orders to stop confidential information from becoming public in breach of this agreement.\ng. Attorneys' fees. In any dispute relating to this agreement the prevailing party will be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.\nh. Transfers of this agreement. If one of us transfers this agreement, we will not disclose the other's confidential information to the transferee without the other's consent.\ni. Enforceability. If any provision of this agreement is unenforceable, the parties (or, if we cannot agree, a court) will revise it so that it can be enforced. Even if no revision is possible, the rest of this agreement will remain in place.\nj. Entire agreement. This agreement does not grant any implied intellectual property licenses to confidential information, except as stated above. We may have contracts with each other covering other specific aspects of our relationship (\"other contracts\"). The other contract may include commitments about confidential information, either within it or by referencing another non-disclosure agreement. If so, those obligations remain in place for purposes of that other contract. With this exception, this is the entire agreement between us regarding confidential information. It replaces all other agreements and understandings regarding confidential information. We can only change this agreement with a signed document that states that it is changing this agreement.\n",

Any breach of this confidentiality undertaking by any of the parties\u2019 employees and agents shall be deemed to be a breach of this agreement by that party in terms of 9 below.\n4. DISCLAIMER\nAll rights to confidential information are reserved by the disclosing party and no rights or obligations, other than those expressly recited herein, are granted or to be implied from this agreement. Nothing in this agreement or its operation shall preclude, impair or restrict either party from continuing to engage in its business. It is recorded that the disclosing party may well have had business dealings with the receiving party\u2019s customers and no right of exclusivity shall be afforded to the receiving party in this regard. For example, in larger corporate entities, it may well be that the receiving party and disclosing party are dealing with separate departments or individuals or may well have done so previously. The receiving party accepts this fact and whilst the disclosing party shall not intentionally interfere with the receiving party\u2019s marketing strategy, this may at times be inevitable.\n5. RETURN OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\nEither party may request in writing at any time that any confidential information or any documents containing such confidential information, disclosed pursuant to the terms of this agreement and any copies thereof be returned with a written statement to the effect that upon such return the receiving party has not knowingly retained in its possession or under its control, either directly or indirectly, any such confidential information or any documents containing such confidential information or any copies thereof and the receiving party shall comply with any such request within seven days of receipt of such request.\n6. TITLE\nAll confidential information of the disclosing party is acknowledged by the receiving party to be the property of the disclosing party and the disclosure of the confidential information shall not be deemed to confer any rights to that confidential information on the receiving party.\n7. STANDARD OF CARE\nThe parties agree to protect the confidential information of the other party using not less than the same standard of care that would be applied to its own proprietary, secret or confidential information and that the confidential information shall be stored and disclosed in such a way as to prevent unauthorised disclosure.\n8.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\n1.1 Definition. When used herein, Confidential Information shall mean any information and data (in electronic form, in hard copy or given verbally) of a confidential or proprietary nature which is disclosed by the Disclosing Party to the Receiving Party, including but not limited to, group corporate strategy and initiatives, customer information, Target information, proprietary technical, financial, personnel and/or commercial information with respect to the Proposed Transaction, Transnet or the Target and any information which is disclosed pursuant to this Agreement and marked \u201cConfidential\u201d by the Disclosing Party. Confidential information specifically excludes the following:\n1.1.1 information which is in the public domain or enters the public domain other than by reason of a breach of the terms of this Agreement;\n1.1.2 where it becomes available to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Disclosing Party or the individual members of the Disclosing Party, as the case may be;\n1.1.3 where it was known to the Receiving Party prior to having access to the Confidential information; and\n1.1.4 where the Receiving Party is obliged to disclose by law, or by order or under the rules of any competent regulatory authority or court.\n1.2 Purpose. The purpose of the disclosure of Confidential Information is to enable the Target\u2019s assets and liabilities relevant to the Proposed Transaction to be assessed.\n1.3 Ownership. The Confidential Information is and shall be considered valuable trade secrets owned exclusively by the Disclosing Party. The Disclosing Party retains all right, title and interest in the Confidential Information and any reasonably related information which may be subsequently developed, and the Receiving Party waives all rights to the intellectual property and copyright therein in favour of the Disclosing Party.\n1.4 No License. No license is granted to the Receiving Party in relation to any intellectual property rights that attach to or may be embodied in any Confidential Information, or is implied by the conveying of such Confidential Information to the Receiving Party.\n1.5 No Warranties. The Disclosing Party assumes no responsibility for any loss or damages suffered by the Receiving Party or any third party caused by or arising from the Confidential Information, and the Disclosing Party makes no warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information.\n1.6 Authorised. The Disclosing Party is authorised to provide Confidential Information to the Receiving Party.\n2. NON-DISCLOSURE\n2.1 Use of Confidential Information. The Receiving Party may use the Confidential Information solely for the purposes of assessing the Target for purposes of the Proposed Transaction. The Receiving Party recognises that this Agreement imposes an affirmative duty to hold such information in confidence and protect it from dissemination to and use by any unauthorised persons. In the absence of the Disclosing Party\u2019s prior written consent, the Receiving Party shall not produce nor disclose the Confidential Information, or any part thereof, to any third party.\n2.2 Disclosure of Confidential Information. The Confidential Information is proprietary information and for the exclusive and non-transferable use of the persons to whom it is addressed and the recipients of the Confidential Information agree that all of the information contained herein is of a confidential nature and is subject to this Confidentiality Agreement, and that they will not, directly, or indirectly, disclose or permit their agents or affiliates to disclose any such information without the prior written consent of Transnet except as expressly permitted by the terms of this Agreement.\n2.3 Return of Confidential Information. Promptly following the request of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party will deliver to the Disclosing Party all confidential information (and copies and extracts thereof) furnished to, or created by or on behalf of, the Receiving Party. Notwithstanding the return of the Confidential Information, the Receiving Party will continue to be bound by its obligations of confidentiality and other obligations hereunder.\n2.4 Remedies. The Receiving Party recognises and acknowledges that the Confidential Information is of a special, unique and extraordinary character to the Disclosing Party and the Target and the disclosure, misappropriation or unauthorised use of such Confidential Information by the Receiving Party cannot be fully compensated and that, further, any such disclosure, misappropriation or unauthorised use of the Confidential Information shall cause irreparable injury to the Disclosing Party and/or the Target. The Receiving Party expressly agrees, therefore, that the Disclosing Party, in addition to any rights and remedies it may have under this Agreement or at law or in equity, shall be entitled to seek injunctive and other equitable relief to prevent the breach, or the further breach, of any of the provisions of this Agreement. The Receiving Party agrees to reimburse the Disclosing Party for any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs, opportunity costs, and direct or indirect expenses (including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, profit opportunity returns foregone and any court costs) incurred by the Disclosing Party as a result of any prima facie breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party.\n3.

This agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their successors and assigns.\n3.3 Waiver. The waiver or failure of either Party to exercise in any respect any right provided for in this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of any further right under this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law or otherwise unenforceable, it shall be enforced to the extent legally permissible and as necessary to reflect the intent of the Parties and shall not affect the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.\n3.4 Variation. No amendment, alteration, addition or variation of the Agreement or any provision or term thereof, or any agreement or other document issued or executed pursuant to or in terms of this Agreement shall be binding unless recorded in a written document signed by the Parties.\n3.5 Binding Agreement.

This Agreement shall be deemed to be a contract made under the laws of the Republic of South Africa and shall be governed by such laws without reference to any principles relating to resolving conflicts of law. The distribution of the Confidential Information in overseas jurisdictions may be restricted by law and therefore persons into whose possession that Confidential Information comes should inform themselves about and observe any such restrictions.\n3.7 Copyrights and Proprietary Rights. The Receiving Party shall not remove any copyright or proprietary rights notice attached to or included in the Confidential Information.\n3.8 Entire Agreement. This Agreement represents the entire agreement between Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.\n3.9 Storage of Confidential Information.

      "text": "NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (NDA)\nThis Nondisclosure Agreement (the \"Agreement\") is entered into by and between _______________ with its principal offices at _______________, (\"Disclosing Party\") and _______________, located at _______________ (\"Receiving Party\") for the purpose of preventing the unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information as defined below. The parties agree to enter into a confidential relationship concerning the disclosure of certain proprietary and confidential information (\"Confidential Information\").\n1. Definition of Confidential Information. For purposes of this Agreement, \"Confidential Information\" shall include all information or material that has or could have commercial value or other utility in the business in which Disclosing Party is engaged. If Confidential Information is in written form, the Disclosing Party shall label or stamp the materials with the word \"Confidential\" or some similar warning. If Confidential Information is transmitted orally, the Disclosing Party shall promptly provide writing indicating that such oral communication constituted Confidential Information.\n2. Exclusions from Confidential Information. Receiving Party's obligations under this Agreement do not extend to information that is: (a) publicly known at the time of disclosure or subsequently becomes publicly known through no fault of the Receiving Party; (b) discovered or created by the Receiving Party before disclosure by Disclosing Party; (c) learned by the Receiving Party through legitimate means other than from the Disclosing Party or Disclosing Party's representatives; or (d) is disclosed by Receiving Party with Disclosing Party's prior written approval.\n3. Obligations of Receiving Party. Receiving Party shall hold and maintain the Confidential Information in strictest confidence for the sole and exclusive benefit of the Disclosing Party. Receiving Party shall carefully restrict access to Confidential Information to employees, contractors and third parties as is reasonably required and shall require those persons to sign nondisclosure restrictions at least as protective as those in this Agreement. Receiving Party shall not, without the prior written approval of Disclosing Party, use for Receiving Party's benefit, publish, copy, or otherwise disclose to others, or permit the use by others for their benefit or to the detriment of Disclosing Party, any Confidential Information. Receiving Party shall return to Disclosing Party any and all records, notes, and other written, printed, or tangible materials in its possession pertaining to Confidential Information immediately if Disclosing Party requests it in writing.\n4. Time Periods. The nondisclosure provisions of this Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement and Receiving Party's duty to hold Confidential Information in confidence shall remain in effect until the Confidential Information no longer qualifies as a trade secret or until Disclosing Party sends Receiving Party written notice releasing Receiving Party from this Agreement, whichever occurs first.\n5. Relationships. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute either party a partner, joint venture or employee of the other party for any purpose.\n6. Severability. If a court finds any provision of this Agreement invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement shall be interpreted so as best to affect the intent of the parties.\n7. Integration. This Agreement expresses the complete understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter and supersedes all prior proposals, agreements, representations, and understandings. This Agreement may not be amended except in writing signed by both parties.\n8. Waiver. The failure to exercise any right provided in this Agreement shall not be a waiver of prior or subsequent rights.\n9. Notice of Immunity. Employee is provided notice that an individual shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that is made (i) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. An individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual (i) files any document containing the trade secret under seal; and (ii) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.\nThis Agreement and each party's obligations shall be binding on the representatives, assigns and successors of such party. Each party has signed this Agreement through its authorized representative.\nDISCLOSING PARTY\nSignature _____________________________________________________\nTyped or Printed Name ___________________________ Date: _______________\nRECEIVING PARTY\nSignature _____________________________________________________\nTyped or Printed Name ___________________________ Date: _______________\n",

The rights of the Disclosing Party under this Agreement are in addition to and not exclusive of rights under the general law and may be waived only in writing and specifically. Delay in exercising or non-exercise of any right under this Agreement is not a waiver of that or any other right, partial exercise of any right under this Agreement shall not preclude any further or other exercise of that right or any other right under this Agreement and waiver of a breach of any term of this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver of breach of any other term or any subsequent breach of that term.\n17. If any provision of this Agreement is or becomes illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, that shall not affect:\na. the legality, validity or enforceability in that jurisdiction of any other provision of this Agreement; or\nb. the legality, validity or enforceability in any other jurisdiction of that or any other provision of this Agreement.\n18.

No counterpart shall be effective until each Party has executed at least one counterpart.\n21. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by English law and the Parties hereby submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the English Courts.\nThe Parties have caused this Agreement to be executed by their duly authorised representatives.\nENERGY TECHNOLOGIES INSTITUTE LLP\nBy: ________________________________\nName: _____________________________\nTitle: _______________________________\nDate: ______________________________\n",

I hereby acknowledge that I have received a security indoctrination concerning the nature and protection of information to which I have been provided conditional access, including the procedures to be followed in ascertaining whether other persons to whom I contemplate disclosing this information have been approved for access to it, and that I understand these procedures.\n 2. By being granted conditional access to the information indicated above, the United States Government has placed special confidence and trust in me and I am obligated to protect this information from unauthorized disclosure, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the laws, regulations, and directives applicable to the specifi c categories of information to which I am granted access.\n3. I attest that I understand my responsibilities and that I am familiar with and will comply with the standards for protecting such information that I may have access to in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the laws, regulations, and/or directives applicable to the specifi c categories of information to which I am granted access. I understand that the United States Government may conduct inspections, at any time or place, for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the conditions for access, dissemination, handling and safeguarding information under this Agreement.\n4. I will not disclose or release any information provided to me pursuant to this Agreement without proper authority or authorization. Should situations arise that warrant the disclosure or release of such information I will do so only under approved circumstances and in accordance with the laws, regulations, or directives applicable to the specific categories of information. I will honor and comply with any and all dissemination restrictions cited or verbally relayed to me by the proper authority.\n5. (a) For PCII - (1) Upon the completion of my engagement as an employee, consultant, or subcontractor under the contract, or the completion of my work on the PCII Program, whichever occurs first, I will surrender promptly to the PCII Program Manager or his designee, or to the appropriate PCII officer, PCII of any type whatsoever that is in my possession.\n(2) If the Authorized Entity is a United States Government contractor performing services in support of the PCII Program, I will not request, obtain, maintain, or use PCII unless the PCII Program Manager or Program Manager\u2019s designee has first made in writing, with respect to the contractor, the certification as provided for in Section 29.8(c) of the implementing regulations to the CII Act, as amended.\n(b) For SSI and SBU - I hereby agree that material which I have in my possession and containing information covered by this Agreement, will be handled and safeguarded in a manner that affords sufficient protection to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of or inadvertent access to such information, consistent with the laws, regulations, or directives applicable to the specific categories of information. I agree that I shall return all information to which I have had access or which is in my possession 1) upon demand by an authorized individual; and/or 2) upon the conclusion of my duties, association, or support to DHS; and/or 3) upon the determination that my official duties do not require further access to such information.\n6. I hereby agree that I will not alter or remove markings, which indicate a category of information or require specific handling instructions, from any material I may come in contact with, in the case of SSI or SBU, unless such alteration or removal is consistent with the requirements set forth in the laws, regulations, or directives applicable to the specific category of information or, in the case of PCII, unless such alteration or removal is authorized by the PCII Program Manager or the PCII Program Manager\u2019s designee. I agree that if I use information from a sensitive document or other medium, I will carry forward any markings or other required restrictions to derivative products, and will protect them in the same matter as the original.\n7. I hereby agree that I shall promptly report to the appropriate official, in accordance with the guidance issued for the applicable category of information, any loss, theft, misuse, misplacement, unauthorized disclosure, or other security violation, I have knowledge of and whether or not I am personally involved. I also understand that my anonymity will be kept to the extent possible when reporting security violations.\n8. If I violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such violation may result in the cancellation of my conditional access to the information covered by this Agreement. This may serve as a basis for denying me conditional access to other types of information, to include classified national security information.\n9. (a) With respect to SSI and SBU, I hereby assign to the United States Government all royalties, remunerations, and emoluments that have resulted, will result, or may result from any disclosure, publication, or revelation of the information not consistent with the terms of this Agreement.\n(b) With respect to PCII I hereby assign to the entity owning the PCII and the United States Government, all royalties, remunerations, and emoluments that have resulted, will result, or may result from any disclosure, publication, or revelation of PCII not consistent with the terms of this Agreement.\n10. This Agreement is made and intended for the benefit of the United States Government and may be enforced by the United States Government or the Authorized Entity. By granting me conditional access to information in this context, the United States Government and, with respect to PCII, the Authorized Entity, may seek any remedy available to it to enforce this Agreement including, but not limited to, application for a court order prohibiting disclosure of information in breach of this Agreement. I understand that if I violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement, I could be subjected to administrative, disciplinary, civil, or criminal action, as appropriate, under the laws, regulations, or directives applicable to the category of information involved and neither the United States Government nor the Authorized Entity have waived any statutory or common law evidentiary privileges or protections that they may assert in any administrative or court proceeding to protect any sensitive information to which I have been given conditional access under the terms of this Agreement.\n11. Unless and until I am released in writing by an authorized representative of the Department of Homeland Security (if permissible for the particular category of information), I understand that all conditions and obligations imposed upon me by this Agreement apply during the time that I am granted conditional access, and at all times thereafter.\n12. Each provision of this Agreement is severable. If a court should find any provision of this Agreement to be unenforceable, all other provisions shall remain in full force and effect.\n13. My execution of this Agreement shall not nullify or affect in any manner any other secrecy or non-disclosure Agreement which I have executed or may execute with the United States Government or any of its departments or agencies.\n14. These restrictions are consistent with and do not supersede, conflict with, or otherwise alter the employee obligations, rights, or liabilities created by Executive Order No. 12958, as amended; Section 7211 of Title 5, United States Code (governing disclosures to Congress); Section 1034 of Title 10, United States Code, as amended by the Military Whistleblower Protection Act (governing disclosure to Congress by members of the military); Section 2302(b)(8) of Title 5, United States Code, as amended by the Whistleblower Protection Act (governing disclosures of illegality, waste, fraud, abuse or public health or safety threats); the Intelligence Identities Protection Act of 1982 (50 USC 421 et seq.) (governing disclosures that could expose confidential Government agents); and the statutes which protect against disclosure that may compromise the national security, including Sections 641, 793, 794, 798, and 952 of Title 18, United States Code, and Section 4(b) of the Subversive Activities Act of 1950 (50 USC 783(b)). The definitions, requirements, obligations, rights, sanctions, and liabilities created by said Executive Order and listed statutes are incorporated into this agreement and are controlling.\n15. Signing this Agreement does not bar disclosures to Congress or to an authorized official of an executive agency or the Department of Justice that are essential to reporting a substantial violation of law.\n16. I represent and warrant that I have the authority to enter into this Agreement.\n17. I have read this Agreement carefully and my questions, if any, have been answered. I acknowledge that the briefing officer has made available to me any laws, regulations, or directives referenced in this document so that I may read them at this time, if I so choose.\nDEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY\nNON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nAcknowledgement\nTyped/Printed Name: Government/Department/Agency/Business Address Telephone Number:\nI make this Agreement in good faith, without mental reservation or purpose of evasion.\nSignature:\nWITNESS:\nTyped/Printed Name: Government/Department/Agency/Business Address Telephone Number:\nSignature:\nThis form is not subject to the requirements of P.L. 104-13, \u201cPaperwork Reduction Act of 1995\u201d 44 USC, Chapter 35.\n",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party will at all times have the right to commence proceedings in any other court of its choice with the appropriate jurisdiction for interim injunctive relief.

Contractor shall notify National Grid promptly, and in no event later than five (5) days after discovery, in writing, of any unauthorized access, possession, use, destruction or disclosure of Personal Information (a \u201cSecurity Breach\u201d). Contractor shall promptly and in writing provide National Grid with full details of the Security Breach, and shall use reasonable efforts to mitigate such Security Breach and prevent a recurrence thereof. Security Breaches include, but are not limited to, a virus or worm outbreak, cyber security intrusions into systems directly responsible for supporting National Grid data and services, physical security breaches into facilities directly responsible for supporting National Grid data and services, and other directed attacks on systems directly responsible for supporting National Grid data and services.

In the event of a Security Breach, the parties shall cooperate to (a) mitigate and resolve any data privacy or security issues involving Personal Information, and (b) make any notifications to individuals affected by the Security Breach, and/or governmental/administrative entities as required by Law. Contractor\u2019s failure to comply with this Article 2.9 shall be considered a material breach of the Non-Disclosure Agreement, for which no cure period shall apply.\n2.10 Following a Security Breach, National Grid, or its designated agent, shall have the right, upon reasonable notice to Contractor, to complete a review of Contractor\u2019s security measures and ensure that unauthorized access to Personal Information has been eliminated.\n2.11 Contractor agrees to ensure that any subcontractor or vendor to which it provides National Grid\u2019s Information, including Personal Information received from National Grid, or to which it provides National Grid\u2019s Information and/or Personal Information created or received by Contractor on behalf of National Grid, agrees to the same restrictions and conditions set forth herein through a written contractual agreement.\n2.12 Contractor agrees that National Grid\u2019s data, including Personal Information, may not be maintained, stored, or transmitted outside of the United States of America, except for entities that are legally affiliated with Contractor or are wholly owned subsidiaries of Contractor.\n2.13 Contractor agrees that it shall be responsible for any and all acts of any subcontractors or vendors to which it allows access to National Grid Information and/or Personal Information.\n2.14 Contractor shall provide National Grid with a list of all subcontractors and vendors that will have access to National Grid\u2019s Confidential and/or Personal Information.\n2.15 Contractor understands the extremely sensitive nature of the Information, including Personal Information it receives from National Grid, and acknowledges that National Grid would suffer irreparable harm, for which damages would not be an adequate remedy, if National Grid\u2019s Personal Information were improperly disclosed. Contractor therefore agrees that National Grid shall be entitled to seek and obtain equitable relief in addition to all other remedies at law to protect its Personal Information.\n2.16 Contractor agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, it shall be and remain strictly liable for the security of all Personal Information when in Contractor\u2019s possession and when being transmitted from Contractor or received by Contractor. Without limiting any other obligations under any agreement entered into between the Parties, Contractor agrees that it shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless National Grid and its Affiliates and their officers, directors, employees, agents, servants, successors and assigns, from and against any and all claims, losses, demands, liabilities, costs and other expenses (including but not limited to, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, administrative penalties and fines, costs expended to notify individuals and/or to prevent or remedy possible identity theft, financial harm or any other claims of harm related to a breach) incurred as a result of, or arising directly out of or in connection with any acts or omissions of Contractor or any party under its control, including, but not limited to, negligent or intentional acts or omissions, resulting from a Security Breach or encryption failure in the transmission of such Personal Information, except to the extent such act or omission is caused by the sole negligence of National Grid. This provision shall survive termination of this Addendum, the Non-Disclosure Agreement and any other agreement between the Parties relevant to the Purpose.\n2.17 Contractor shall maintain or cause to be maintained sufficient insurance coverage as shall be necessary to insure Contractor and its employees, agents, Representatives and subcontractors against any and all claims or claims for damages arising under this Addendum and the Non-Disclosure Agreement and such insurance coverage shall apply to all services provided by Contractor or its Representatives, agents or subcontractors.\n2.18 When required by law, by a court or by other governmental or regulatory authorities (including, without limitation, an employment tribunal), Contractor shall provide, and formally document, a method that ensures that it can secure, preserve, and transfer digital evidence and artifacts to National Grid in a format that shall comply with such law or be admissible by such court or authority. Deviations from the documented method, either ad-hoc or permanent (e.g. due to new case law or technological advancements), must be agreed upon by the Parties in advance and must still adhere to the aforementioned format and documentation requirements.\n2.19 In the event that Contractor fails to fulfill the above obligations or in the event that such failure appears to be an imminent possibility, National Grid shall be entitled to all legal and equitable remedies afforded it by law as a result thereof and may, in addition to any and all other forms of relief, recover from the undersigned all reasonable costs and attorneys\u2019 fees encountered by it in seeking any such remedy.\n3.0 DATA SCRUBBING VERIFICATION\n3.1 Upon termination of all agreements between the Parties relevant to and in connection with the Purpose, Contractor shall return to National Grid all Personal Information or destroy such Personal Information beyond recovery and certify such destruction in writing to National Grid. Without limiting the foregoing, upon termination of all agreements between the Parties relevant to and in connection with the Purpose, Contractor shall use the best possible means to scrub, or otherwise destroy beyond recovery all electronic Personal Information in its possession, certifying such destruction in writing to National Grid\u2019s procurement agent, and providing National Grid with a written explanation of the method used for data disposal/destruction, along with a written certification that such method meets or exceeds the National Grid\u2019s data handling standards and industry best practices for the disposal/destruction of sensitive data. If such return or destruction is not feasible, Contractor shall provide to National Grid notification of the conditions that make return or destruction infeasible. Upon National Grid\u2019s written agreement that return or destruction of Personal Information is infeasible, Contractor shall extend the protections of this Addendum to such Personal Information and limit further uses and disclosures of such Personal Information to those purposes that make the return or destruction infeasible, for so long as Contractor maintains such Personal Information.\n4.0 AUDIT\n4.1 Contractor shall, from time to time during the term of the Non-Disclosure Agreement and for a period of seven (7) years thereafter, during regular business hours and upon reasonable notice, permit National Grid or its representatives to perform audits of Contractor\u2019s facilities, equipment, books and records (electronic or otherwise), operational systems and such other audits as may be necessary to ensure: (a) Contractor\u2019s compliance with this Addendum, (b) Contractor\u2019s compliance with all applicable Law, and (c) Contractor\u2019s financial and operational viability, including but not limited to Contractor\u2019s internal controls, security policies, business resumption, continuity, recovery, and contingency plans.\n4.2 National Grid requires an annual written self-certification from Contractor based on an independent third party audit that scrutinizes and confirms the effectiveness of controls. If Contractor fails to perform its audit obligations hereunder, National Grid (or an independent third party auditor on its behalf that is subject to confidentiality obligations) may audit Contractor and subservice providers control environments and security practices relevant to services provided once in any twelve (12)-month period, with reasonable prior written notice (at least seven (7) days\u2019 notice) and under reasonable time, place and manner conditions.\n4.3 In addition to the above, National Grid may also request Contractor to participate in an audit and information disclosure in the event (a) National Grid receives any audit requests from a governmental or regulated agency, and/or (b) within 24 hours if Contractor suffers a Security Breach.\n5.0 MISCELLANEOUS\n5.1 Where applicable, if, and only with National Grid\u2019s prior consent, Contractor processes Personal Information received from National Grid from the \u201cEuropean Economic Area\u201d or \u201cEEA\u201d (as defined below) in a jurisdiction that is not an approved jurisdiction under the EEA, Contractor shall ensure that it has a legally approved mechanism in place to allow for the international data transfer prior to the transfer of any such Personal Information and Contractor will abide by the obligations under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the General Data Protection Regulation, fair and lawful use requirements, together with any additional implementing legislation, rules or regulations that are issued by applicable supervisory authorities with respect to such Personal Information. The \u201cEEA\u201d means those countries that are members of European Free Trade Association (EFTA), and the then-current, post-accession member states of the European Union.\n5.2 Contractor agrees to cooperate fully with National Grid and to execute such further instruments, documents and agreements, and to give such further written assurances as may be reasonably requested by the other Party, to better evidence and reflect the transactions described in and contemplated by this Addendum, and to carry into effect the intents and purposes of this Addendum.\n5.3 The terms of this Addendum shall survive the termination of all agreements between the Parties related to or in connection with the Purpose for any reason.\nCEII Exhibit\nList of Contractor Representatives Authorized to Receive CEII\nSchedule A\nCERTIFICATE OF NON-DISCLOSURE\nI, the undersigned, hereby certify my understanding that the Information which includes critical energy/electric infrastructure information (\u201cCEII\u201d) is being provided to me pursuant to the terms and restrictions of the Non-Disclosure Agreement by and between National Grid and ____________ dated _________, ___ 20__ (\u201cNon-Disclosure Agreement\u201d).

For avoidance of doubt, the Buyer will at all times act in good faith and will only transact and deal with Seller/s and/or Business/es, via the brokerage, intervention and mediation of Aldes.\n6.3 The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Aldes is, will be and will remain entitled to receipt of its agreed brokerage commission (albeit due and payable by the Seller/s, the Business/es, the Buyer or any of them), should the Buyer (albeit directly itself or indirectly through any of its subsidiaries, holding companies, group companies, related parties and/or inter-related parties or otherwise indirectly) or anyone else the Buyer may have introduced to the Business/es and/or Seller/s, conclude any agreements and/or transactions contemplated in clauses 2.1 and/or 2.2 above with (or with regard to) any Business/es and/or Seller/s.\n7.

BUYER\u2019S INFORMATION\n8.1 The Buyer notes that Aldes\u2019 decision to introduce any Business/es for sale to the Buyer (and the Seller/s and/or Business/es decision to enter into discussions with the Buyer) is, in part, based on the information presented by the Buyer under and in terms of the Buyer\u2019s Profile on the face of this Agreement. As such, the Buyer warrants and guarantees that all information presented and provided via and in terms of the Buyer\u2019s Profile was, is and will remain true, complete and accurate and that it will immediately inform Aldes should there be any change in the information provided/presented.\n9.

Should the Buyer fail and/or refuse to enter into and conclude such further agreements, Aldes may, in its sole and absolute discretion, refuse to disclose further information to the Buyer regarding any and/or all Seller/s and/or Business/es.\n9.2 It is noted and agreed that the Buyer and certain of the Seller/s and/or Business/es may from time to time enter into and conclude one or more confidentiality and/or non-disclosure agreements amongst, by and between themselves. It is noted and agreed that those agreements will be in addition to, and not in substitution of/for, this Agreement. Those Agreements will in no way, manner or form detract from, limit, terminate and/or negate any of the terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement, unless Aldes has given its specific prior written consent to the contrary.\nDated and signed this __________ day of ______________________________________________________\nSignature: _______________________________________________________________\nName and Surname: _______________________________________________________________\nIdentity Number: _______________________________________________________________\nHe/She being duly authorised thereto for and on behalf of the Buyer\n",

Transmission (collectively, \"DESC\"), and South Carolina Public Service Authority (\"Santee Cooper\"), a state-owned electric and water utility organized and existing under the laws of the state of South Carolina and located at 1 Riverwood Dr., Monks Corner, SC 29461 (each of DESC and Santee Cooper, a \"Disclosing Party\" and DESC and Santee Cooper collectively, the \"Disclosing Parties\"), enter into this Non-Disclosure Agreement (\"Agreement\") as of _________________________ (\"Effective Date\").\nBackground. The Disclosing Parties may, in their discretion, provide the Receiving Party information related to their confidential and critical energy infrastructure information.\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants made herein, and with the intent to be legally bound hereby, the Receiving Party agrees as follows:\n1. Confidential Information. The term \"Confidential Information\" means all written, electronic, printed or other materials disclosed by the Disclosing Parties, and all information ascertained through discussions with the Disclosing Parties, concerning the planning process. Confidential Information shall include, but is not limited to, all analyses, compilations, forecasts, studies, models, \"base cases\", plans, procedures, calculations, reports or other documents prepared by the Disclosing Parties that may contain or reflect such information.\n2. Critical Energy Infrastructure Information. The term \"Critical Energy Infrastructure Information\" or \"CEII\" as used in this Agreement refers to the official definition provided in 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 388.113(c)(1). CEII shall be protected under the terms of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, CEII shall also include any information which may be described as non-public transmission information including, but not limited to, the following: maps, charts, and diagrams, including location, longitude and latitude for either or both of the Disclosing Parties' electric systems; and system studies including flow studies, models, \"base cases\" and system planning for either or both of the Disclosing Parties. All CEII is also Confidential Information. Given the sensitive nature of CEII, the Receiving Party has a higher duty of care to maintain the confidentiality of this information.\n3. Disclosure and Use of Confidential Information.\nThe Receiving Party shall use the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of its internal evaluation. The Receiving Party shall not make any other use, in whole or in part, of any such Confidential Information without the prior written consent of the respective Disclosing Party.\nThe Receiving Party agrees that, in complying with its confidentiality obligations under this Agreement, it shall exercise the same care used to protect its own confidential proprietary information, but no less than reasonable care, to prevent the disclosure and to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information. If the Receiving Party is an individual, the Receiving Party may not disclose any Confidential information to any person or entity without the Disclosing Parties' prior written consent in each instance. If the Receiving Party is a company, the Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information (i) to the Receiving Party's directors, officers and employees (collectively, \"Representatives\"), in each case only to the extent reasonably necessary for the Receiving Party's internal use and only after informing each Representative of the restrictions in this Agreement on the disclosure and use of the Confidential Information and that he or she must comply with such restrictions, and (ii) to any other person or entity only with the Disclosing Parties' prior written consent in each instance. The Receiving Party agrees to take all reasonable steps to cause its Representatives to comply with the terms of this Agreement and to be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any Representative.\nThe Receiving Party shall keep all Confidential Information strictly confidential and shall not, without the respective Disclosing Party's prior written consent in each instance, disclose Confidential Information or any reports, work product or other documents containing any Confidential Information to any third party, firm, corporation or entity.\nExcept as may be required by applicable law, without the prior written consent of the respective Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall not: (a) confirm or deny any statement made by a third party regarding Confidential Information and/or CEII/CII; (b) disclose to any person the fact that Confidential Information and/or CEII/CII have been made available to it; (c) confirm that any investigations, discussions or negotiations are taking place; or (d) disclose any of the terms or conditions with respect to same. If any such actions are required by applicable law, the Receiving Party shall comply with the requirements of Section 5 below.\n4. Additional Provisions Relating to Disclosure and Use of CEII.\nThe Receiving Party shall not use CEII, in whole or in part, for any purpose other than that for which the CEII was specifically provided, without the prior written consent of the respective Disclosing Party. The Receiving Party may make copies of CEII, but such copies become CEII and subject to these same terms and conditions. The Receiving Party shall not knowingly use CEII for an illegal or non-legitimate purpose. The Receiving Party agrees that, in complying with its obligations under this Agreement, it shall employ an enhanced standard of care in order to prevent the disclosure and to protect the confidentiality of the CEII. The Receiving Party shall maintain CEII in a secure manner and place and shall be responsible for ensuring that its Representatives who receive CEII do the same.\nThe Receiving Party shall not, without the respective Disclosing Party's prior written consent in each instance, disclose CEII or any reports, work product or other documents containing any CEII to any third party, firm, corporation or entity. The Receiving Party may disclose CEII (i) only to its Representatives who have properly executed individual non-disclosure or confidentiality agreements in the course of their employment specifically pertaining to confidential information and CEII they receive in the course of their employment and (ii) only after informing each Representative of the restrictions in this Agreement on the disclosure and use of the CEII and that he or she must comply with such restrictions.. Further, such disclosure must be limited to the extent that it is reasonably necessary to evaluate the subject matter of the requested materials. The Receiving Party agrees to take all reasonable steps to cause its Representatives to comply with the terms of this Agreement and to be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any Representative. The Receiving Party shall not disclose any CEII to any of its Representatives who have been convicted of any felony.\nExcept as allowed under Section 5, Required Disclosure, the Receiving Party shall not submit CEII obtained from the Disclosing Parties to any government agency for any reason without first obtaining written permission from the respective Disclosing Party, and then fully complying with the requirements of 18 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 388.112, 113 for requesting special treatment of the CEII.\n5. Required Disclosure. In the event that the Receiving Party is requested or required by depositions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil investigation, demand or similar process (i) to disclose any CEII or other Confidential Information received pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) to disclose any discussions pertaining thereto, or (iii) to take any other action described in the last paragraph of Section 3 above, the Receiving Party shall provide to the relevant Disclosing Parties prompt written notice of such request(s) and shall use reasonable efforts to resist disclosure until an appropriate protective order may be sought. If, in the absence of a protective order, Receiving Party is nonetheless, in the written opinion of its counsel, legally required to disclose CEII or other Confidential Information received pursuant to this Agreement, then, in such event Receiving Party may disclose such information after the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party written notice of the proposed disclosure and a reasonable opportunity to review the proposed disclosure.\n6. Return of Documents and Destruction of Electronically Stored Information. Disclosing Parties may elect at any time to terminate further use of or access to the CEII. In such case, the Receiving Party shall return any and all CEII upon the Disclosing Party's written re(cid:84)uest, including all hardcopy originals, copies, translations, notes, reports, schematics, flowcharts, e-mails, tape recordings, or any other form of said material, without retaining any copy or duplicate supplement thereof and shall promptly destroy any and all written, printed or other material or information derived from the Confidential Information. The Receiving Party shall provide attested certification from an authorized representative confirming such return and destruction \"provided however, Receiving Party may retain one (1) copy of such documentation in its secure legal files for the sole purpose of administering its obligations under this agreement, as well as copies of electronically exchanged Confidential Information that are made as a matter of routine information technology back-up, which copies shall continue to be kept confidential in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.\"\n7. Survival of Obligations. Regardless of any termination of any business relationship between the Parties, the obligations and commitments established by this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.\n8. Nature of Information; Injunctive Relief. The Receiving Party hereby accepts the representations of Disclosing Parties that the CEII disclosed pursuant to this Agreement is of a special, unique, extraordinary, and intellectual character and that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party or its representatives and that specific performance and injunctive or other equitable remedies for any such breach shall be available to it. If there is a breach, then Disclosing Parties shall be entitled, in addition to all other rights and remedies which they may have at law or in equity, to seek to have a decree of specific performance or an injunction issued by any competent court, requiring the breach to be cured or enjoining all persons involved from continuing the breach. The Receiving Party also acknowledges that the interests of Disclosing Parties in such CEII may be irreparably injured by disclosure. The remedy stated above may be pursued in addition to any other remedies applicable at law or equity for breach of this Agreement. The existence of any claim or cause of action which either party may have against the other shall not constitute a defense or bar to the enforcement of any of the provisions of this Agreement.\n9. Governing Law. The validity and interpretation of this Agreement and the legal relations of the Receiving Party and Disclosing Parties to it shall be governed by the laws of the State of South Carolina, excluding its conflict of laws principles. Any action arising out of the performance of this Agreement must be filed and resolved exclusively in a state or federal court or tribunal sitting in the State of South Carolina. The parties consent and submit to the jurisdiction and venue of those courts and tribunals.\n10. No Other Agreement.

DEFINED TERMS\n1.1 In this Agreement, the following definitions shall apply:\nAgreement means this Non-Disclosure Agreement for Project Proposals.\nConfidential Information means all information relating to the Project or the Contractor\u2019s proposal for the Project and all information relating to the nature of either Party\u2019s business, affairs or trade secrets, which either Party directly or indirectly receives or acquires from the other Party, or the other Party\u2019s representative, either in writing or verbally (but in the case of verbal information, only that which is reduced to writing by the Disclosing Party and delivered to the Receiving Party within 10 days of the verbal disclosure), or through observation of the Project, except information falling into any one or more of the following categories:\n(a) information which the Receiving Party can show was in its possession on a non-confidential basis before receipt of the information from the Disclosing Party;\n(b) information which is lawfully in the public domain at the time of the Receiving Party\u2019s receipt of the information from the Disclosing Party, but not including the Company\u2019s request for proposals for the Project;\n(c) information which, after the Receiving Party\u2019s receipt of the information from the Disclosing Party, becomes part of the public domain through no act of the Receiving Party or of any third party under an obligation of confidence with respect to such information, but only after such information becomes part of the public domain; or\n(d) information which, after receipt of the information by the Receiving Party, is lawfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party, but only after such information is so received, and provided such third party is under no obligation of confidence with respect to such information.\nDisclosing Party means the Party disclosing Confidential Information.\nEffective Date means the date on which this Agreement is deemed to be effective, as first written above.\nInitial Term means the 1 year period commencing on the Effective Date and expiring at 11:59 pm. on _____________, 20__.\nParty means either the Company or Contractor and Parties means both of them.\nPermitted Purpose means the purpose for which the Confidential Information is disclosed by the Disclosing Party to the Receiving Party and which is more particularly described as:\n(i) responding to the Company\u2019s request for proposals for the Project, in the case of the Contractor;\n(ii) assessing the Contractor\u2019s proposal, in the case of the Company; and\n(iii) if applicable, negotiation by the Parties of a definitive agreement related to the Project.\nPermitted Recipients means those persons who have a need to know the Confidential Information for the Permitted Purpose and who are officers, directors, employees, agents or contractors (at any level) of the Receiving Party or its affiliates, or anyone else for whom the Receiving Party takes responsibility for under this Agreement.\nProject means the Company\u2019s project in relation to which it is seeking proposals for performance of work or services or the provision of materials or equipment.\nReceiving Party means the Party receiving Confidential Information from the Disclosing Party.\n2. PERMITTED PURPOSE\n2.1 The Company and the Contractor believe it is in their mutual best interest to disclose information to support the Permitted Purpose. Either Party may disclose Confidential Information to the other for the Permitted Purpose, which disclosure will be governed by the Agreement.\n3. PROTECTION\n3.1 Except as expressly permitted by this Agreement, the Receiving Party shall not disclose the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information and shall use reasonable care, which is at least the same degree of care that the Receiving Party ordinarily uses with respect to its own proprietary information, in relation to the use, transmittal and storage of the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information.\n3.2 The Receiving Party shall not use the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party for any purpose other than the Permitted Purpose and, subject to section 3.3, shall limit the disclosure of the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to Permitted Recipients.\n3.3 The Receiving Party shall not make any copies, reproductions or abstracts of the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party except as specifically may be required for the Permitted Purpose. All copies, reproductions and abstracts of the Confidential Information shall also be deemed to be Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to the same extent as any originals.\n3.4 Before disclosing any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to the Permitted Recipients, the Receiving Party shall identify to the Permitted Recipients that it is the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information and is subject to disclosure and usage restrictions, and shall ensure that the Permitted Recipients have:\n(a) executed Appendix A \u2013 Permitted Recipient\u2019s Acknowledgement; or\n(b) are bound in writing by confidentiality terms, policies or procedures no less restrictive than those in this Agreement.\n3.5 The Receiving Party will be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by the Permitted Recipients.\n3.6 Confidential Information shall be used and stored in secure locations that are not accessible to the personnel who are not Permitted Recipients.\n3.7 The Receiving Party shall immediately notify the Disclosing Party, in writing, upon the earlier of knowing of any application to obtain any disclosure order or of any disclosure order being granted which would require disclosure of any part or all of the Confidential Information. The Receiving Party shall cooperate reasonably with the Disclosing Party, at the Disclosing Party\u2019s expense, in challenging the disclosure order or obtaining a protective order. The Receiving Party will disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information which is required by such disclosure order.\n4. RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES\n4.1 This Agreement is not intended to and does not obligate either Party:\n(a) to disclose any specific Confidential Information; or\n(b) to enter into any subsequent business arrangements regarding the Permitted Purpose or any other matter.\n4.2 This Agreement does not create any exclusivity between the Parties; each Party remains free to negotiate and enter into any agreement with any third party covering all or any part of the Permitted Purpose without any liability to the other Party under this Agreement.\n4.3 No joint venture, partnership or other fiduciary relationship shall be deemed to exist or arise between the Parties as a result of this Agreement or exchanging Confidential Information.\n5. TERM AND RETURN OR DESTRUCTION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\n5.1 This Agreement shall govern all disclosures of Confidential Information made during the Initial Term.\n5.2 Any disclosure of any Confidential Information to the Receiving Party made during the Initial Term shall continue to be subject to this Agreement for a period of 2 years thereafter, provided that any trade secret shall be entitled to protection for the life of the trade secret.\n5.3 Subject to section 5.4, within 10 days of a written request by the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall, unless otherwise precluded by any legal obligation:\n(a) return to the Disclosing Party or destroy all of the Disclosing Party\u2019s original tangible Confidential Information, together with all tangible copies and reproductions;\n(b) subject to subsection 5.3(c), make its best efforts to delete all electronic copies of the Confidential Information received from the Disclosing Party;\n(c) safeguard any electronic Confidential Information that cannot be destroyed due to the Receiving Party\u2019s archiving practices or policies with the same degree of care as it would its own Confidential Information; and\n(d) retain electronic Confidential Information described in subsection 5.3(c) only for the period it normally maintains such records, which electronic Confidential Information shall remain subject to the provisions of this Agreement until destroyed.\n5.4 Notwithstanding anything in section 5.3, the Receiving Party shall not be obliged to return or destroy any derivative materials or reports prepared by the Receiving Party for the Permitted Purpose, which materials and reports shall nonetheless remain subject to the confidentiality obligations in this Agreement.\n5.5 Upon request of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall certify in writing to the Disclosing Party that it has complied with section 5.3.\n6. REMEDIES\n6.1 Each Party acknowledges that monetary damages would be inadequate to protect the other Party against any actual or threatened breach of this Agreement, and, without prejudice to any other rights and remedies otherwise available to the other Party, agrees to the granting of injunctive relief in favour of the other Party without proof of actual damages.\n6.2 The Receiving Party shall indemnify the Disclosing Party against any loss or damage suffered by the Disclosing Party as a result of the failure of the Receiving Party or such other persons who are disclosed Confidential Information under this Agreement to comply with the terms of this Agreement.\n7. COSTS AND EXPENSES\n7.1 Each Party shall pay its own costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement.\n8. NOTICES\n8.1 All notices required pursuant to this Agreement shall be in writing delivered by personal service or commercial carrier to:\nIf to Company: If to Contractor:\n8.2 Should either Party change its address while the Agreement is in effect, it is the obligation of that Party to provide notice to the other Party, in writing, of its new address and the date the new address is effective prior to changing its address.\n9. GENERAL PROVISIONS\n9.1 All Confidential Information provided by the Disclosing Party remains its property and the Receiving Party obtains no right of any kind to any Confidential Information provided to it.\n9.2 This Agreement is not intended to and does not grant, expressly or by implication, any right or license to any permit, patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret, improvement, or any other intellectual property right or similar proprietary right of any kind that the other Party may possess.\n9.3 Neither Party's failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege preclude any other or further exercise thereof.\n9.4 Neither Party may assign its rights or delegate its duties under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party, or otherwise dispose of any right, title or interest in all or part of this Agreement, including assignment by operation of law or otherwise, without such consent. Either Party may grant or withhold consent in its sole discretion. The terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any permitted successor of either Party.\n9.5 To the extent that any statute, regulation or other legislation applies to the Confidential Information, the Parties shall comply with same.\n9.6 If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, void, or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, that holding shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement.\n9.7 This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties concerning its subject matter and supersedes all prior agreements and conduct, whether written or oral.\n9.8 This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted under the laws of the Province of Alberta and the Parties consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Alberta for all disputes arising out of this Agreement.\n9.9 This Agreement shall only be amended in writing and signed by authorised representatives of both Parties.\nThis Agreement has been executed by the duly authorised representatives of the Parties, effective as of the Effective Date and may be executed and delivered electronically and in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same Agreement.\nCOMPANY CONTRACTOR\nBy: By:\nPrinted Name: Printed Name:\nTitle: Title:\nAppendix A \u2013 Permitted Recipient\u2019s Acknowledgement\nI _______________________________ [name], am _______________________________ [position] with _______________________________ [Company or Contractor] and have read and understood the attached Non-Disclosure Agreement for Project Proposals (the \u201cAgreement\u201d).\nI acknowledge that I am one of the individuals defined in the Agreement as a Permitted Recipient of Confidential Information.\nI agree to be bound by the same obligations of confidentiality that bind the Company and the Contractor. I also agree that disclosure of Confidential Information that is not in accordance with the Agreement will cause irreparable harm and significant injury to the Party to whom that Confidential Information belongs and that it may be difficult to ascertain and that specific performance or injunctive relief, in addition to other legal and equitable relief, may be appropriate remedies for any actual or threatened violation or breach of confidentiality by me.\nThis Permitted Recipient\u2019s Acknowledgement has been executed by the Permitted Recipient effective as of the Effective Date.\n",

or\n(vii) is at the time of disclosure known to the Recipient or thereafter becomes generally available to the public, other than as a result of a disclosure by the Recipient or any of the Recipient's Representatives in breach of this Agreement.\nThe foregoing exclusions do not apply to Confidential Information that is personal information.\n(c) \"Definitive Agreement\" means a binding definitive written agreement to consummate a Transaction;\n(d) \"party\" means a party to this Agreement and \"parties\" means all parties to this Agreement;\n(e) \"Permitted Purpose\" shall have the meaning set out in Recital C;\n(f) \"Person\" is to be broadly interpreted to include any individual, corporation, company, partnership or limited partnership, limited liability company, trust or other group or entity or organization (including any court, government or agency, commission, board or authority thereof, federal, state or local, domestic, foreign or multinational);\n(g) \"Representatives\" means, in respect of a party, such party\u2019s agents, directors, officers, employees, representatives, consultants and advisers (including legal counsel);

As a condition to receiving the Confidential Information, the Recipient agrees to treat confidentially, and not to disclose, and to cause the Recipient\u2019s Representatives to treat confidentially and not disclose (except as permitted herein), any Confidential Information.\n3. The Recipient hereby recognizes and acknowledges the competitive value and confidential nature of the Confidential Information and the damage that would result to the Company, if any of the Confidential Information is disclosed to any third party. Accordingly, the Recipient hereby agrees that the Confidential Information will be used solely for the Permitted Purpose and not any other purpose.\n4. The Recipient may disclose Confidential Information only to the limited group of the Recipient's Representatives, who are actually engaged in and need to know the Confidential Information for the Permitted Purpose, who have been informed of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information, and who agree to keep such information confidential and not use such Confidential Information for any purpose other than the Permitted Purpose. The Recipient shall ensure that each of the Recipient's Representatives will observe all terms and conditions of this Agreement. The Recipient further agrees that it shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of the Recipient's Representatives, and that the Recipient shall take all reasonable measures, including, without limitation, court proceedings, at the Recipient\u2019s sole expense, to restrain the Recipient\u2019s Representatives from making unauthorized disclosure or use of the Confidential Information.\n5. The Confidential Information shall remain at all times the property of the Company. No rights to use, license, or otherwise exploit the Confidential Information are granted to the Recipient, by implication or otherwise, by virtue of Confidential Information being made available to the Recipient or any of the Recipient\u2019s Representatives.\n6. The Recipient acknowledges and agrees that the Company would not have an adequate remedy at law and would be irreparably damaged by any unauthorized disclosure or use of any Confidential Information or in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by the Recipient and the Recipient\u2019s Representatives in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached by the Recipient or any of the Recipient's Representatives. Without prejudice to the rights and remedies otherwise available to the Receiver, the Recipient agrees that the Receiver shall be entitled, without the requirement of posting a bond or other security, to equitable relief, including an injunction or specific performance, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this Agreement by the Recipient or the Recipient's Representatives. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be exclusive remedies but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity to the Receiver or the Company. In the event of litigation relating to this Agreement, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the Recipient or any of the Recipient's Representatives have breached this Agreement, then the Recipient shall be liable and pay to the Receiver the reasonable costs and expenses (including attorney's fees on a full indemnity solicitor and his own client basis) incurred by the Receiver in connection with such litigation, including any appeal therefrom. The Recipient shall indemnify and hold harmless the Receiver and the Receiver's directors, officers, employees, consultants, representatives, advisors and agents from all damages and losses of any nature whatsoever (including consequential damages) arising out of a breach by the Recipient or any of the Recipient's Representatives of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.\n7. The Recipient agrees that the Receiver shall not disclose to the Recipient or any of the Recipient\u2019s Representatives information about identifiable individuals forming part of the Confidential Information (\"Personal Information\") unless required by the Recipient, acting reasonably, for the purpose of evaluating the Transaction. If Personal Information is provided to the Recipient, then:\n(a) the Recipient shall comply with the Canada Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, S.C. 2000, c. 5, as amended, and any similar provincial legislation governing the protection of personal information in the private sector applicable to the Recipient in the course of collecting, using and disclosing Personal Information in connection with the Transaction;\n(b) prior to the closing of the Transaction (the \"Closing\"), the Recipient shall: (i) collect and use Personal Information only for the purpose of evaluating the Transaction; (ii) only disclose Personal Information to those of the Recipient\u2019s Representatives who need to know such Personal Information for the purpose of evaluating the Transaction; and (iii) use appropriate security measures to safeguard all Personal Information against unauthorized collection, access, use or disclosure; and\n(c) if the Transaction proceeds, following the Closing, the Recipient shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, use or disclose Personal Information obtained as a result of the Transaction only for purposes of carrying on the business conducted by the Company or the carrying out of the objects for which the Transaction took place or otherwise for purposes for which such Personal Information was collected by the Company, unless the consent for other use or disclosure has been obtained from the individuals to whom such Personal Information relates has been obtained as permitted or required by law.\n8. In the event you or any of the Recipient's Representatives become legally compelled (by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigation, demand, order or other legal process) to disclose any of the contents of the Confidential Information, or either the fact that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning a possible Transaction between the Receiver and you, or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any such possible Transaction, including the status thereof, the Company agrees that you and the Recipient's Representatives may do so without liability, provided you (i) cooperate with the Receiver in any attempts it may make to obtain a protective order or other appropriate assurance that confidential treatment will be afforded the Confidential Information, and (ii) if no protective order is obtained and disclosure is required, (a) furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information that, in your counsel's opinion, you are legally compelled to disclose, and (b) take all reasonable measures to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the Confidential Information.\n9. The Receiver may elect at any time to terminate further access by the Recipient to the Confidential Information. If at any time the Recipient determines not to proceed with the possible Transaction, the Recipient will promptly notify the Receiver in writing. Following any request by the Receiver or any of its Representatives, the Recipient agrees (i) to promptly re-deliver to the Receiver all written Confidential Information and any other written material containing or reflecting any of the Confidential Information in the possession of the Recipient or the Recipient's Representatives, (ii) the Recipient and the Recipient's Representatives will not retain any copies, extracts or other reproductions in whole or in part, mechanical or electronic, of such written material, and (iii) all Notes prepared by the Recipient or the Recipient's Representatives will be destroyed, with all such destruction being confirmed by the Recipient to the Receiver in writing.\n10. Except to the extent necessary to carry out the Permitted Purpose, none of the Recipient or its Representatives are allowed to make copies of Confidential Information without the prior written approval of the Receiver (excepting that copies made by virtue of electronic communications or storage or printed copies for review by a permitted individual shall not be a breach of this prohibition).\n11. Notwithstanding Section 9 or anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Recipient and its Representatives are not required to destroy any computer files containing the Confidential Information that are created during automatic computer system backup, provided that such files are stored securely by the Recipient and its Representatives, cannot be destroyed without undue efforts, and access to such files are limited. With respect to such backup computer files, the non-use and confidentiality obligations set forth in this Agreement shall apply in perpetuity and survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.\n12. If the Recipient or any of the Recipient's Representatives are provided with physical access to any properties or facilities of the Company, the Recipient agrees that neither the Recipient nor any of the Recipient\u2019s Representatives shall have, and shall not make, any claims whatsoever against the Receiver, or any of its Representatives as a result of such access including, without limitation, any and all claims and causes of action for personal injury, death or property damage occurring as a result of the Recipient or any of the Recipient's Representatives' access to such properties or facilities and the Recipient agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Receiver, or any of its Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, claims and causes of action for personal injury, death or property damage occurring on or to such property or facility as a result of entry onto the premises by the Recipient or any of the Recipient\u2019s Representatives. You shall, and shall cause your Representatives to, comply fully with all rules, regulations and instructions issued by the Receiver regarding you or the Recipient's Representatives' access to such properties or facilities.\n13. The Recipient understands and acknowledges that neither the Receiver nor any of its Representatives makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information. The Recipient agrees that neither the Receiver nor any of its Representatives shall have any liability to the Recipient or any of the Recipient's Representatives relating to or resulting from use of the Confidential Information by the Recipient or the Recipient\u2019s Representatives. The Recipient further understands and agrees that (i) the Receiver (a) shall be free to conduct the process for a Transaction as it in its sole discretion shall determine (including changing or terminating such process, providing any information to any other Person, negotiating with any other Person or entering into a Definitive Agreement with any other Person with respect to any transaction, in each case, at any time and without notice to you or any other Person) and (b) shall be free at its sole discretion to at any time accept or reject any proposal relating to the Assets for any reason without notice to you or any other Person, and (ii) the Recipient shall have no claim against the Receiver or any of its Representatives in connection with any of the foregoing.\n14. The Recipient hereby represents and warrants that it is not bound by the terms of any agreement with a third party that would conflict with any of the Recipient\u2019s obligations under this Agreement.\n15. In accepting and reviewing the Confidential Information, the Recipient represents and warrants that it is acting solely for itself. Further, the Recipient represents and warrants that neither the Recipient nor any of the Recipient's Representatives have discussed or shared, and the Recipient hereby covenants that unless it has first received the written consent of the Receiver neither the Recipient nor any of the Recipient's Representatives will discuss or share, with any third party any aspect of the Confidential Information, except in accordance with Section 4 or 8 of this Agreement. The Recipient acknowledges that the effect of this covenant is that without the full disclosure to and the written consent of the Receiver, neither the Recipient nor any of the Recipient's Representatives can act as agent, partner, co-participant or co-venturer for any third party or third parties with respect to a proposed Transaction. In order to obtain the consent of the Receiver, which the Receiver is entitled to withhold in its sole discretion, the Recipient shall notify the Receiver of the identity of each Person for whom or with whom the Recipient or any of the Recipient's Representatives had considered pursuing a possible Transaction and the nature and interest the Recipient or any of the Recipient's Representatives and each such Person would have in respect of such possible Transaction.\n16. The Recipient agrees that, unless and until a Definitive Agreement is entered into between the Receiver and the Recipient with respect to the Transaction, neither the Receiver nor the Recipient will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to the Transaction by virtue of this or any other written or oral expression, except with respect to the matters specifically agreed to herein. Except for the matters set forth in this Agreement or in any Definitive Agreement, neither party shall be entitled to rely on any statement, promise, agreement or understanding, whether oral or written, any custom, usage of trade, course of dealing or conduct.\n17. The Recipient agrees that all (i) communications regarding the Transaction, (ii) requests for additional information, (iii) requests for facility tours or management meetings, and (iv) discussions or questions regarding procedures, will be submitted or directed only to the Receiver. The Recipient further agrees that under no circumstances will the Recipient or the Recipient's Representatives discuss or otherwise communicate any aspect of the Transaction to any member of the management of the Company without the express written permission of the Receiver. Without the Receiver's prior written consent, the Recipient shall not, and shall direct the Recipient's Representatives not to, make any contact of any nature regarding a proposed Transaction (including inquiries or requests concerning Confidential Information) with any employee, supplier, customer, creditor, bank or other lender of or to the Company or any of its Affiliates.\n18. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile or electronic transmission and in any number of counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed an original, but such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same agreement.\n19. The Recipient agrees that the restrictions contained in this Agreement are reasonable in order to protect the legitimate interests of the Receiver and the Company and all defences to the strict enforcement of the restrictions by the Receiver are hereby waived by the Recipient.\n20. If any term or provision of this Agreement is declared to be void or unenforceable in whole or in part by a court of competent jurisdiction, it shall be deemed to be severable from the rest of this Agreement and it shall not affect or impair the enforceability or validity of any other covenant or provision of this Agreement.\n21. This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws in force in the Province of Alberta. The Recipient hereby irrevocably attorns to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of the Province of Alberta for the determination of all matters arising hereunder in the event the Receiver should bring an action on this Agreement in the Courts of the Province of Alberta. The Recipient hereby agrees that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiver may bring an action on this Agreement in any jurisdiction where the Recipient has assets or in any jurisdiction where this Agreement has been breached or where a breach is threatened, and in such an event, the Recipient hereby irrevocably attorns to the jurisdiction of the Courts of such jurisdictions for the determination of all matters arising hereunder.\n22. This Agreement will continue indefinitely, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Receiver.\n23. No waiver of any particular requirement hereunder shall be construed as a general waiver of this Agreement, and any failure by or delay by the Receiver in enforcing its rights against any particular breach of this Agreement shall not limit or affect its rights to enforce its rights against any other breach hereof.\n24. This Agreement may not be assigned by the Recipient without the prior written consent of the Receiver.\n25. This Agreement shall enure to the benefit of the Receiver and its successors and assigns and shall be binding upon the Recipient and its successors and permitted assigns.\n26. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto and supersedes all prior contracts, agreements and understandings pertaining to the subject matter of this Agreement. No modification or alteration of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by the parties hereto. There are no representations, warranties, collateral agreements or conditions affecting this transaction other than as are expressed or referred to herein in writing.\n27. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall in any way limit the rights or remedies available to the Receiver at law, in equity or under statute arising in any way in connection with the disclosure of the Confidentiality Information in the event of a breach or a threatened breach of this Agreement. IN WITNESS WHEREOF the parties have executed this Agreement on the day and year first above written.\nFTI CONSULTING CANADA INC., in its capacity as Receiver and Manager of Phenomenome Discoveries Inc. and Phenomenome Laboratory Services Inc., and not in its personal or corporate capacity,\nPer:\n______________________________________\nPer:\nName of Recipient (please print)\nSignature of Recipient and/or Signing Officer\n",

Confidential Information. VENDOR acknowledges that in the course of providing services to UNIVERSITY, VENDOR will be given or have access to confidential student and/or employee information (\u201cConfidential Information\u201d) protected from disclosure by privacy laws. VENDOR, its employees, agents, contractors and subcontractors shall, in addition to their respective obligations hereunder, use best efforts at all times to adopt and follow procedures and practices to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information and prevent its disclosure to others without the express written consent of UNIVERSITY.\nVENDOR specifically, acknowledges Federal privacy laws such as Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (Title 15, United States Code, Sections 6801(b) and 6805(b)(2)) applicable to financial transactions and Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (Title 20, United States Code, Section 1232g) applicable to student records and information from student records.\nVENDOR further acknowledges that UNIVERSITY\u2019S willingness to disclose Confidential Information to VENDOR is predicated on VENDOR entering into committing to abide by the terms of this Agreement and all applicable privacy laws.\n2. Nondisclosure. VENDOR, its employees, agents, contractors, and subcontractors shall use the Confidential Information solely in connection with performance by VENDOR of the services provided to UNIVERSITY and for no other purpose. Neither VENDOR nor any of its employees, agents, contractors, or subcontractors shall sell, release, transfer, reprint, duplicate, recreate, disclose or permit the disclosure to any other person or entity of any of the Confidential Information or of any files, compilation, study, report, or analysis or data base containing, based on, or derived from the Confidential Information without the express written consent of UNIVERSITY and in full compliance with applicable state and federal privacy laws.\nVENDOR shall maintain the privacy of protected personal information and shall be financially responsible, if and to the extent that any security breach relating to protected personal information results from acts or omissions of VENDOR, or its personnel, for any notifications to affected persons (after prompt consultation with UNIVERSITY), and to the extent requested by UNIVERSITY, administratively responsible for such notification.\n3. Disclosure Sought Under Legal Process. VENDOR shall immediately notify UNIVERSITY in writing of any subpoena, court order, or other legal process seeking or purporting to compel disclosure of any of the Confidential Information and shall challenge, oppose, or appeal any such subpoena, order, or legal process to the extent deemed appropriate by UNIVERSITY. In no event shall VENDOR voluntarily, without a court order, disclose or permit the disclosure of any of the Confidential Information in response to legal process unless and until VENDOR has given the required notice to UNIVERSITY and VENDOR has exhausted any and all legal remedies available to it to limit or prevent the disclosure.\n4. Return of Materials. Upon request of UNIVERSITY at any time VENDOR shall return all or such part of the Confidential Information as UNIVERSITY may designate to be returned. In addition, upon the completion of the services provided by VENDOR to UNIVERSITY, VENDOR shall return or destroy, as UNIVERSITY may instruct, all Confidential Information in VENDOR\u2019S possession or control, whether in printed, electronic or any other format, including all duplicates and copies thereof of any files, compilation, study, report, analysis, or data base containing, based on or derived from the Confidential Information.\n5. Loss of Access. VENDOR\u2019S disclosure of Confidential Information to third parties without UNIVERSITY\u2019S authorization, or VENDOR\u2019S failure to return or destroy Confidential Information per Provision 4, above may result in the UNIVERSITY or the U.S. Department of Education denying VENDOR access to Confidential Information for a period of at least five years.\n6. Immediate Notice. VENDOR shall give UNIVERSITY immediate notice of any unauthorized use or disclosure of the Confidential Information, or of any breach or threatened breach by VENDOR, or its employees, agents, contractors, or subcontractors of their obligations under this Agreement, upon learning of same.\n7. Appropriate Forum. VENDOR and UNIVERSITY agree that this Agreement is entered into in the State of Arkansas and that the legal forums located in the State of Arkansas are the appropriate forums in the event any party seeks legal action or injunctive relief under this Agreement. Both parties consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in the appropriate forum in the State of Arkansas.\n8. Termination. This Agreement shall survive the termination of the services to be provided by VENDOR or any other agreement by and between the parties.\n9. Severability. All of the provisions of this agreement are severable. If any provision of this Agreement is rendered invalid or unenforceable by State or Federal statute or regulations or declared null and void by any court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.\n10. Entire Agreement Amendments. This Agreement is intended as the complete, final and exclusive statement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes any prior agreements or understandings between the parties hereto. This Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented only by a written agreement signed by VENDOR and UNIVERSITY. Any waiver of the terms and conditions of this Agreement must be in writing signed by the party granting such waiver and shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure to perform.\n11. Original Copy. Signed originals of this agreement will be kept on file in the Office of the Information Technology, Arkansas State University, Jonesboro, Arkansas. Copy of signed originals will be provided to VENDOR.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, and intending to be legally bound, the parties have executed this Agreement by their duly authorized representatives.\nVENDOR\nSignature:_________________________________Date:__________________\nPrintName:________________________________Title:___________________\nARKANSAS STATE UNIVERSITY-JONESBORO\nSignature:_________________________________Date:___________________\nPrintName:_______________________________Title:____________________\n",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Recipient may make such disclosure if it is required to do so by law, provided always that Recipient has informed Discloser about such disclosure at least two business days prior to the disclosure.\n4.2 Discloser warrants that it authorizes the Recipient to use the Confidential Information for the Purpose.\n4.3 Nothing in this agreement or any disclosure hereunder creates any obligation to disclose Confidential Information, use the Confidential Information in any product, warrant the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information, or the fitness of the Confidential Information for a particular purpose, or grant any license or other right to Confidential Information under copyright or other intellectual property right to the Discloser other than the right to use the Confidential Information for the Purpose.\n4.4 The Discloser disclaims all warranty that the use of the Confidential Information does not infringe upon the rights of any third party or otherwise causes damages. The Discloser shall not be liable for any damages resulting from the infringement of third party rights or otherwise.\n5 WAIVER\n5.1 Any failure or delay to enforce any provision of this agreement shall not constitute a waiver thereof or of any other provision, unless the respective party expressly waives its right to enforce such provision in writing.\n6 ASSIGNMENT\n6.1 Neither party may assign or otherwise transfer its rights and obligations out of this agreement, neither in whole nor in part, without the other party\u2019s prior written consent.\n7 APPLICABLE LAW & JURISDICTION\n7.1 This agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with Austrian law, excluding its conflict of laws provisions and each party hereby irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the courts in Graz, Austria.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this agreement to be duly executed by their duly authorized representatives.\nCONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT\nAnton Paar GmbH\n_______________, ____________________ Graz, ____________________\n_________________________________ _________________________________\n (signature) (signature)\nName: Name:\nTitle: Title:\n_________________________________ _________________________________\n (signature) (signature)\nName: Name:\nTitle: Title:\n",

The parties maintain a supply relationship. In the frame of this cooperation, confidential information also be exchanged.\n2. Every contract party can disclose confidential information to the other contract party orally or in writing. If the disclosure is in writing, the disclosing party will mark the confidential documents with the additional terms \u201cConfidential\u201d or \u201cLiable to Secrecy\u201d so that it is apparent to the other party which information is especially in need to protection.\n3. The contract parties are obligated to preclude disclosure of confidential information to third parties. The parties will entrust confidential information solely to those employees, consultants and third party companies which are concerned with the processing of the order and which are legally or contractually obligated to secrecy.\n4. To the extent that technical drawings of certain third-party companies are not to be made known, the buyer must point this fact out on its own initiative.\n5. All confidential information remains the property of the disclosing contract party.\n6. The confidentiality agreement does not apply to statements of the company Helukabel in its catalogues, datasheets and on the homepage and also not to information which\na) the receiving party was already aware of or which was developed by the disclosing party itself independent of the disclosure,\nb) is publicly known without this agreement having been broken,\nc) was received by a third party without infringement of this or any other confidentiality agreement.\n7. If the recipient is forced to expose the confidential information due to a legal regulation, a legally valid judgement or a non-disputable official decision or decree in part or in whole, it shall immediately inform the owner of the confidential information in writing so that the owner can take measures to protect the confidential information.\n8. This agreement becomes effective with the signatures of both parties and is valid for three years. It is tacitly extended by one year if it is not terminated three months before its expiration.\n9. At the end of the contract the receiving party shall return the confidential information and any possibly extant copies after receipt of a written request, provided that this is technically feasible and does not violate the retention obligations. As an alternative to that, the receiving party can also ensure in writing the destruction of the received documentation if that is technically feasible.\n10. The confidential information will be provided as is. The disclosing party does not assume any warranty for the correctness, completeness or usability of the confidential information.\n11. The parties agree that for this agreement German law applies excluding the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. The legal venue for all disputes arising from this agreement is the head office of the company Helukabel in Hemmingen.\nHemmingen, ___________ _____________________\nPlace, Date\n_________________________ _____________________\nHelu Kabel GmbH Buyer\n",

Definition of Confidential Information.

Confidentiality of Discussions. Unless otherwise required by law, without the prior written consent of the other Party, neither a Party nor its representatives shall disclose to any person (including any corporation, company, partnership or individual) either the fact that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning a possible transaction between the Parties or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any such possible transaction, including the status thereof.\n8. Assignment. This Agreement and the rights and obligations of either Party under this Agreement may be assigned or transferred only upon the prior written approval of the other Party hereto.

Choice of Law. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF UTAH, EXCLUDING CHOICE OF LAW AND CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES WHICH DIRECT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF A DIFFERENT STATE.

Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and any Party hereto may execute any such counterpart, each of which when executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original and all of which counterparts taken together shall constitute but one and the same instrument. This Agreement shall become binding when all counterparts taken together shall have been executed and delivered by the Parties. A telecopied facsimile of an executed counterpart of this Agreement shall be sufficient to evidence the binding agreement of each Party to the terms hereof.\n13. RELEASE.

A copy of any such agreement shall be available for inspection upon request by the KDOL and will not be subject to disclosure to third parties by anyone other than KDOL.\nAuthorized Person agrees that any confidential information or reports generated from such confidential information shall be in aggregate form, and shall not in any way contain personally identifiable information or information which alone, or in combination with other information, is linked, or is linkable, to a specific individual, and which would thereby allow a reasonable person in the community, who does not have personal knowledge of the relevant circumstances, to identify the individual with reasonable certainty. Additionally, Authorized Person agrees that the Authorized Person will use confidential information or reports generated from such confidential information only for the purpose stated in the first paragraph of this agreement.\nAny information maintained by KDOL that has been obtained pursuant to the administration of the Employment Security Law, shall be held confidential and shall not be published or be open to public inspection, other than to public employees in the performance of their public duties, in any manner revealing an individual\u2019s or employing unit\u2019s identity.\nAuthorized Person agrees to comply with all data storage requirements in IRS Publication 1075 for all information systems used for receiving, processing, storing, or transmitting confidential information obtained pursuant to this agreement.\nBoth parties shall exercise reasonable and prudent security procedures to protect such information, reports, returns and other documentation in their possession, including electronic versions thereof, from any unauthorized access and/or disclosure.

Printed material to be burned must be burned in an incinerator that produces enough heat to burn the entire bundle, or the bundle must be separated to ensure that all pages are incinerated. Printed material to be shredded must be shredded in the following manner: The paper must be inserted so that lines of print are perpendicular to the cutting line; The paper must be shredded to effect 5/16-inch-wide or smaller strips. Consideration should be given to the use of cross-cut shredders; If shredding deviates from the 5/16-inch specification, Confidential information must be safeguarded until it reaches the stage where it is rendered unreadable through additional means, such as burning or pulping.\nConfidential information obtained pursuant to this agreement that is stored in electronic format must be destroyed in the following manner: Electronic media (e.g., hard drives, tapes, CDs, and flash media) must be destroyed according to IRS Publication 1075 guidance in Section 9.3.10.6, Media Sanitization (MP-6), and Section 9.4.7, Media Sanitization. Electronic media containing confidential information must not be made available for reuse by other offices or released for destruction without first being subjected to electromagnetic erasing. If reuse is not intended, the tape must be destroyed by cutting into lengths of 18 inches or less or by burning to effect complete incineration.\nMicrofilm and microfiche must be shredded to effect 1/35-inch by 3/8-inch strips.\nAuthorized Person agrees to permit KDOL to audit and inspect all Authorized Person\u2019s compliance with these requirements.\nModification of Agreement\nNo modification to this agreement shall be effective unless reduced to writing and signed by the parties hereto.\nAUTHORIZED PERSON KANSAS DEPARTMENT OF LABOR\nBy: ______________________ By: ________________________\nPrint name Print Name\nSignature: ______________________ Signature: ________________________\nDate: _______________ Date: _______________\n",

This includes information categorized by DHS or other government agencies as: For Official Use Only (FOUO); Official Use Only (OUO); Sensitive Homeland Security Information (SHSI); Limited Official Use (LOU); Law Enforcement Sensitive (LES); Safeguarding Information (SGI); Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information (UCNI); and any other identifier used by other government agencies to categorize information as sensitive but unclassified.\nI attest that I am familiar with, and I will comply with the standards for access, dissemination, handling, and safeguarding of the information to which I am granted access as cited in this Agreement and in accordance with the guidance provided to me relative to the specific category of information.\nI understand and agree to the following terms and conditions of my access to the information indicated above:\n1. I hereby acknowledge that I have received a security indoctrination concerning the nature and protection of information to which I have been provided conditional access, including the procedures to be followed in ascertaining whether other persons to whom I contemplate disclosing this information have been approved for access to it, and that I understand these procedures.\n 2. By being granted conditional access to the information indicated above, the United States Government has placed special confidence and trust in me and I am obligated to protect this information from unauthorized disclosure, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the laws, regulations, and directives applicable to the specifi c categories of information to which I am granted access.\n3. I attest that I understand my responsibilities and that I am familiar with and will comply with the standards for protecting such information that I may have access to in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the laws, regulations, and/or directives applicable to the specifi c categories of information to which I am granted access. I understand that the United States Government may conduct inspections, at any time or place, for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the conditions for access, dissemination, handling and safeguarding information under this Agreement.\n4. I will not disclose or release any information provided to me pursuant to this Agreement without proper authority or authorization. Should situations arise that warrant the disclosure or release of such information I will do so only under approved circumstances and in accordance with the laws, regulations, or directives applicable to the specific categories of information. I will honor and comply with any and all dissemination restrictions cited or verbally relayed to me by the proper authority.\n5. (a) For PCII - (1) Upon the completion of my engagement as an employee, consultant, or subcontractor under the contract, or the completion of my work on the PCII Program, whichever occurs first, I will surrender promptly to the PCII Program Manager or his designee, or to the appropriate PCII officer, PCII of any type whatsoever that is in my possession.\n(2) If the Authorized Entity is a United States Government contractor performing services in support of the PCII Program, I will not request, obtain, maintain, or use PCII unless the PCII Program Manager or Program Manager\u2019s designee has first made in writing, with respect to the contractor, the certification as provided for in Section 29.8(c) of the implementing regulations to the CII Act, as amended.\n(b) For SSI and SBU - I hereby agree that material which I have in my possession and containing information covered by this Agreement, will be handled and safeguarded in a manner that affords sufficient protection to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of or inadvertent access to such information, consistent with the laws, regulations, or directives applicable to the specific categories of information. I agree that I shall return all information to which I have had access or which is in my possession 1) upon demand by an authorized individual; and/or 2) upon the conclusion of my duties, association, or support to DHS; and/or 3) upon the determination that my official duties do not require further access to such information.\n6. I hereby agree that I will not alter or remove markings, which indicate a category of information or require specific handling instructions, from any material I may come in contact with, in the case of SSI or SBU, unless such alteration or removal is consistent with the requirements set forth in the laws, regulations, or directives applicable to the specific category of information or, in the case of PCII, unless such alteration or removal is authorized by the PCII Program Manager or the PCII Program Manager\u2019s designee. I agree that if I use information from a sensitive document or other medium, I will carry forward any markings or other required restrictions to derivative products, and will protect them in the same matter as the original.\n7. I hereby agree that I shall promptly report to the appropriate official, in accordance with the guidance issued for the applicable category of information, any loss, theft, misuse, misplacement, unauthorized disclosure, or other security violation, I have knowledge of and whether or not I am personally involved. I also understand that my anonymity will be kept to the extent possible when reporting security violations.\n8. If I violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such violation may result in the cancellation of my conditional access to the information covered by this Agreement. This may serve as a basis for denying me conditional access to other types of information, to include classified national security information.\n9. (a) With respect to SSI and SBU, I hereby assign to the United States Government all royalties, remunerations, and emoluments that have resulted, will result, or may result from any disclosure, publication, or revelation of the information not consistent with the terms of this Agreement.\n(b) With respect to PCII I hereby assign to the entity owning the PCII and the United States Government, all royalties, remunerations, and emoluments that have resulted, will result, or may result from any disclosure, publication, or revelation of PCII not consistent with the terms of this Agreement.\n10. This Agreement is made and intended for the benefit of the United States Government and may be enforced by the United States Government or the Authorized Entity. By granting me conditional access to information in this context, the United States Government and, with respect to PCII, the Authorized Entity, may seek any remedy available to it to enforce this Agreement including, but not limited to, application for a court order prohibiting disclosure of information in breach of this Agreement. I understand that if I violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement, I could be subjected to administrative, disciplinary, civil, or criminal action, as appropriate, under the laws, regulations, or directives applicable to the category of information involved and neither the United States Government nor the Authorized Entity have waived any statutory or common law evidentiary privileges or protections that they may assert in any administrative or court proceeding to protect any sensitive information to which I have been given conditional access under the terms of this Agreement.\n11. Unless and until I am released in writing by an authorized representative of the Department of Homeland Security (if permissible for the particular category of information), I understand that all conditions and obligations imposed upon me by this Agreement apply during the time that I am granted conditional access, and at all times thereafter.\n12. Each provision of this Agreement is severable. If a court should find any provision of this Agreement to be unenforceable, all other provisions shall remain in full force and effect.\n13. My execution of this Agreement shall not nullify or affect in any manner any other secrecy or non-disclosure Agreement which I have executed or may execute with the United States Government or any of its departments or agencies.\n14. These restrictions are consistent with and do not supersede, conflict with, or otherwise alter the employee obligations, rights, or liabilities created by Executive Order No. 12958, as amended; Section 7211 of Title 5, United States Code (governing disclosures to Congress); Section 1034 of Title 10, United States Code, as amended by the Military Whistleblower Protection Act (governing disclosure to Congress by members of the military); Section 2302(b)(8) of Title 5, United States Code, as amended by the Whistleblower Protection Act (governing disclosures of illegality, waste, fraud, abuse or public health or safety threats); the Intelligence Identities Protection Act of 1982 (50 USC 421 et seq.) (governing disclosures that could expose confidential Government agents); and the statutes which protect against disclosure that may compromise the national security, including Sections 641, 793, 794, 798, and 952 of Title 18, United States Code, and Section 4(b) of the Subversive Activities Act of 1950 (50 USC 783(b)). The definitions, requirements, obligations, rights, sanctions, and liabilities created by said Executive Order and listed statutes are incorporated into this agreement and are controlling.\n15. Signing this Agreement does not bar disclosures to Congress or to an authorized official of an executive agency or the Department of Justice that are essential to reporting a substantial violation of law.\n16. I represent and warrant that I have the authority to enter into this Agreement.\n17. I have read this Agreement carefully and my questions, if any, have been answered. I acknowledge that the briefing officer has made available to me any laws, regulations, or directives referenced in this document so that I may read them at this time, if I so choose.\nDEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY\nNON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nAcknowledgement\nTyped/Printed Name: Government/Department/Agency/Business Address Telephone Number:\nI make this Agreement in good faith, without mental reservation or purpose of evasion.\nSignature:\nWITNESS:\nTyped/Printed Name: Government/Department/Agency/Business Address Telephone Number:\nSignature:\nThis form is not subject to the requirements of P.L. 104-13, \u201cPaperwork Reduction Act of 1995\u201d 44 USC, Chapter 35.\n",

The execution of this Agreement does not constitute the creation of a business relationship.\nIT IS AGREED\n1. The Receiving Party agrees to treat all information provided by the Providing Party in connection with the Business Under Discussion to the Receiving Partner and/or any of its partners, directors, officers, employees, affiliates, insurers, agents, advisors or auditors (the \u201cRepresentatives\u201d), regardless of the manner in which it is so furnished, together with any analyses, compilations, data, studies or other documents or records, whether of an oral, written or electronically retrievable nature (collectively the \u201cInformation\u201d), as strictly confidential.\n2. The Receiving Party shall limit the possession and use of the Information to a \u201cneed-to-know\u201d basis among its Representatives.\n3. Information does not include, however, information which (a) is or becomes generally available to the public; (b) was available to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure by the Providing Party; (c) is independently developed by the Receiving Party; or (d) becomes available to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis after the date hereof from a third party which was not known by the Receiving Party to be subject to a confidentiality agreement with the Providing Party and which is not otherwise prohibited from transmitting the information to the Receiving Party.\n4. The Receiving Party agrees that the Information will be used solely for giving effect to the Business Under Discussion and further that it will not disclose to any person (i) the Information and (ii) the fact that the Information has been made available to the Receiving Party or that the Receiving Party have inspected any portion of the Information, for any reason or purpose whatsoever, unless the Providing Party has consented in writing to such disclosure or except as stated otherwise herein or as required by law, order, decree, regulation, or governmental agency request. The term \u201cperson\u201d as used in these provisions shall be broadly interpreted to include without limitation any corporation, company, partnership, individual or group.\n5. In the event that the Receiving Party is required by applicable law or regulation or by legal process to disclose any of the Information, the Receiving Party agrees that it will provide the Providing Party with prompt written notice of such request(s) prior to the required disclosure and the Providing Party shall use reasonable efforts, at its own expense, to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy. If a protective order or other remedy is not obtained and a waiver hereunder is not received, the Receiving Party shall disclose only that portion of the Information which is legally required and shall use its best efforts to obtain assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded to such Information.\n6. If any of the Parties determine that they do not wish to proceed or continue with the Business Under Discussion, it will promptly advise the other Party of that decision in writing or by email. Upon receipt of such communication the Receiving Party shall destroy promptly all documents furnished and will not retain any copies, extracts or other reproductions in whole or in part of such Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party shall be entitled to retain that portion of the Information for legal, regulatory or internal compliance purposes, which will continue to be treated as confidential on the terms hereof.\n7. The Parties agree and understand that, notwithstanding any pending or future disputes between them or any claims relating to or arising from such disputes, the provision of the Information is not intended to and should not be construed as a waiver of any confidentiality or privilege over such material for any other purpose and such confidentiality and privileges are expressly reserved.\n8. Any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement shall constitute a breach that may cause irreparable injury, not readily measurable in money, and for which the Providing Party, without waiving any other rights or remedies at law or in equity, shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief or other equitable relief. Any such right or remedy and any and all other rights or remedies provided for herein shall be cumulative and not exclusive and in addition to any and all other rights or remedies which the Providing Party may have under this Agreement or otherwise.\n9. The Parties agree that, in the event of loss or damage to the Providing Party as a result of breach of the provisions of this Agreement, the Receiving Party shall be liable only in respect of loss or damage resulting directly from the breach, and no liability will be accepted in respect of any special, indirect, incidental or consequential losses or damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to, lost profits or revenue) suffered by the Providing Party or any person connected with the Providing Party, arising out of the performance or breach of this Agreement, whether claims for said losses or damages are premised on contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise.\n10. It is further understood and agreed that no failure or delay by any of the Parties to this Agreement in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder. No modification, amendment or waiver of this Agreement shall be binding unless it is in writing and signed by each of the Parties. There are no third party beneficiaries to this Agreement.\n11. This Agreement shall be governed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales without giving effect to conflict of law principles, and the Parties agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts.\n12. This Agreement constitutes the entire and only agreement between the Parties relating to the non-disclosure of information.\n",

Products of services also fall under this non-disclosure agreement, with the sole exception that the Recipient can use products of services as portfolio examples on the Pitchdeckfire.com website or otherwise, provided that the images are in a non-editable format, and scrubbed clean of branding and specific content (blurred out all logos, company and industry specific content), unless contrary written permission is given by the disclosing party.\nThe Parties hereby agree as follows:\n1. For purposes of this Agreement, \"Confidential Information\" shall mean any and all non-public information, including, without limitation, technical, developmental, marketing, sales, operating, performance, cost, know-how, business plans, business methods, and process information, disclosed to the Recipient. For convenience, the Disclosing Party may, but is not required to, mark written Confidential Information with the legend \"Confidential\" or an equivalent designation.\n2. All Confidential Information disclosed to the Recipient will be used solely for the Business Purpose and for no other purpose whatsoever. The Recipient agrees to keep the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information confidential and to protect the confidentiality of such Confidential Information with the same degree of care with which it protects the confidentiality of its own confidential information, but in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care. Recipient may disclose Confidential Information only to its employees, agents, consultants and contractors on a need-to-know basis, and only if such employees, agents, consultants and contractors have executed appropriate written agreements with Recipient sufficient to enable Recipient to enforce all the provisions of this Agreement. Recipient shall not make any copies of Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information except as needed for the Business Purpose. At the request of Disclosing Party, Recipient shall return to Disclosing Party all Confidential Information of Disclosing Party (including any copies thereof) or certify the destruction thereof.\n3. All right title and interest in and to the Confidential Information shall remain with Disclosing Party or its licensors.

The obligations and limitations set forth herein regarding Confidential Information shall not apply to information which is: (a) at any time in the public domain, other than by a breach on the part of the Recipient; or (b) at any time rightfully received from a third party which had the right to and transmits it to the Recipient without any obligation of confidentiality.\n5. In the event that the Recipient shall breach this Agreement, or in the event that a breach appears to be imminent, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to all legal and equitable remedies afforded it by law, and in addition may recover all reasonable costs and attorneys' fees incurred in seeking such remedies. If the Confidential Information is sought by any third party, including by way of subpoena or other court process, the Recipient shall inform the Disclosing Party of the request in sufficient time to permit the Disclosing Party to object to and, if necessary, seek court intervention to prevent the disclosure.\n6. The validity, construction and enforceability of this Agreement shall be governed in all respects by the law of the state of Colorado. This Agreement may not be amended except in writing signed by a duly authorized representative of the respective Parties.

      "text": "NON-DISCLOSURE AND NON-USE AGREEMENT (First Amendment, January 2008)\nThis Non-Disclosure and Non-Use Agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) is made and entered into by and among\nTHE UNDERSIGNED INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES (each of them being referred to as \u201cReceiving Party\u201d).\nWHEREAS the Receiving Party intends to become party to the REACH Consortium Agreement of 1 January 2007 (the \u201cConsortium Agreement\u201d);\nWHEREAS, pursuant to the provisions of the Consortium Agreement, the Receiving Party will be provided with Materials for registration under Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (\u201cREACH\u201d);\nWHEREAS, Section 14 of the Consortium Agreement requires the signature by each Member of the Consortium of the present Non-Disclosure and Non-Use Agreement;\nNOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the premises and covenants herein contained, it is agreed as follows:\n1. Definitions\nFor the purpose of the present Agreement, \u201cMaterial\u201d is defined as any data, test, study or any information in support of the Registration under REACH made available to the Consortium or generated or determined or used in any way by the Consortium to comply with the requirements of REACH and provided to the Receiving Party for the purpose of registration under REACH. This Material shall include, without limitation: (i) Data and/or Studies acquired, licensed, developed or contracted or obligated for by the Consortium pursuant to Section 10 of the Consortium Agreement; (ii) Registration Dossier - technical dossier comprising studies, including test results; study summaries; proposals for testing; classification and labelling; guidance on safe use; plus a chemical safety report; and (iii) draft Registration Dossier, interim and working documents related to the preparation of the Registration Dossier, know-how, technical information, researches, methods, practices, procedures, processes, formulas and more generally any information with respect to substances that is made available, in written or oral form, to the Receiving Party by the Consortium and/or the Consortium Members. Unless defined herein, the definitions in this Agreement shall be the same as those set forth in the Consortium Agreement.\n2. Non-disclosure and Restriction on Use\nThe Receiving Party agrees to retain the Material in confidence and not to use the Material for any purpose other than in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and of the Consortium Agreement.\nIn Particular, the Receiving Party undertakes (in addition and without prejudice to any commitments under the Consortium Agreement), that:\na. the Receiving Party shall not disclose the Material to any Third Party except with the Steering Committee\u2019s prior written consent and provided that no other legal disclosure requirement applies;\nb. the Material shall neither be copied, nor otherwise reproduced nor duplicated in whole or in part where such copying, reproduction or duplication have not been specifically authorized by the Consortium Agreement or otherwise approved in writing by the Steering Committee;\nThe Receiving Party acknowledges that the covenants of non-disclosure and non-use in this Agreement shall be effective in every country in the world.\nThe Receiving Party shall take all reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure or improper use of the Material, to prevent the material from falling into the public domain, and to protect it from falling into the possession of Third Parties. Such measures include, but shall not be limited to, the highest degree of care that the Receiving Party utilises to protect its own confidential information. In the event of loss or theft of any documents, items of work in progress, or any work products embodying Material, the Consortium Secretariat must be notified immediately by the Receiving Party, who shall cooperate fully in remedying same.\n3. Permitted Disclosure of Material\na. The Receiving Party shall solely disclose the Material to its affiliates, employees and persons in the Receiving Party\u2019s organization who (i) have responsibility for or are directly concerned with the purposes of this Agreement and of the Consortium Agreement; (ii) are subject to non-disclosure or confidentiality obligations to the Receiving Party (the Material constituting protected information for purposes of such obligations); and (iii) have been informed and are fully aware of the Receiving Party\u2019s obligations under this agreement and under the Consortium Agreement.\nb. The Receiving Party may provide its customers with (i) Safety Data Sheets as defined in Article 31 of REACH, (ii) relevant exposure scenarios, or (iii) other available and relevant information about the substance that is necessary to enable appropriate risk management measures to be identified and applied.\nc. The Receiving Party may disclose the Material if and to the extent that such disclosure is required by law or court order, provided that the Receiving Party notifies the Disclosing Party. Any disclosure of Data and/or Studies that could result in public disclosure of the Data and/or Studies shall only be permissible after prior approval from the Steering Committee or the IMOA Executive Committee.\nd. The Receiving Party and its Affiliates may use the Material for compliance with laws and regulations in other non-EU jurisdictions provided that the confidentiality of the Material is guaranteed and in compliance with the NDA. Any disclosure of the Data and/or Studies for the purposes of compliance with non-EU regulatory requirements that could result in public disclosure of the Data and/or Studies shall only be permissible after prior approval from the Steering Committee or the IMOA Executive Committee.\ne. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Non-Disclosure Agreement shall prevent an Individual Member from supplying Data and/or Studies in its possession or control to a Governmental Authority where required to do so by law or regulation and where refusing to do so would require the Individual Member to violate that law or regulation and subject the Individual Member to fines or other sanction by the Governmental Authority.\n4. Exceptions to Non-Disclosure\nThe Receiving Party shall not be subject to the obligations of this Agreement with respect to Material which:\na. is or becomes known publicly through no wrongful act of the Receiving Party; or\nb. was already known to the Receiving Party at the time of disclosure hereunder as shown by the Receiving Party\u2019s prior written records; or\nc. is learned by the Receiving Party from a third party under no obligation to the Consortium; or\nd. is independently developed by an employee, agent, or consultant of the Receiving Party with no knowledge of disclosure hereunder;\ne. is approved for release by the Consortium Committee in compliance with Article 119 of REACH on electronic public access with the decision for submission of a Registration Dossier;\nf. is approved for release by written authorisation of the Steering Committee or the IMOA Executive Committee; or\ng. is publicly disclosed in accordance with the provisions of Section 15 of the Consortium Agreement.\n5. Term\nThis Agreement shall survive until the earlier of (i) such time as all the material disclosed hereunder becomes publicly known pursuant to Section 15 of the Consortium Agreement and made generally available without violation of this Agreement, or (ii) twelve (12) years from date of Registration.\n6. No Licence\nNothing in this Agreement is intended to grant any rights to the Receiving Party under any patent, copyright or any other intellectual property right, nor shall this Agreement grant the Receiving Party any rights in or to the material except as expressly set forth herein and in the Consortium Agreement.\n7. Indemnity\nThe Receiving Party acknowledges and agrees that any breach of this Agreement would cause immediate and irreparable injury to the Consortium and its Members. Should the Receiving Party violate any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Consortium Members shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedies that maybe available, in law, in equity or otherwise, to obtain injunctive relief against the threatened breach of this Agreement or the continuation of any such breach, without the necessity of proving actual damages.\nIn addition, in case of violation of this Agreement, the Receiving Party may be expelled from the Consortium in accordance with the conditions provided in Section 4 of the Consortium Agreement.\n8. Waiver\nNo failure or delay by either party in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right hereunder.\n9. Severability\nIf any one or more of the provisions of this Agreement shall for any reason be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such circumstance shall not affect any other provision of the Agreement and the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and be construed as if such provision, to the extent that it is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, had never been contained herein or therein.\n10. Governing Law and disputes\nThis Agreement shall be governed by, and all disputes arising under or in connection with this Agreement shall be resolved in accordance with the laws of England and Wales.\n11. Amendment\nNo modifications, change, or waiver of this Agreement shall be valid unless made in writing and signed by authorised representatives of the Individual Members.\n12. Counterparts\nThis Agreement will be executed in a number of counterparts, which shall together constitute a single agreement. Each undersigned Receiving Party shall execute two (2) signature pages, retain one for its file and communicate the other to the Consortium Secretariat.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned, by their duly authorised representative(s), have executed and delivered this Agreement.\nCOMPANY NAME:\nBy:\n(Signature)\n(Name)\nTITLE:\nDATE:\n",

Last Man Stands, (the \"Disclosing Party\"); and\n2. _____________, (the \"Receiving Party\"),\nCollectively referred to as the \"Parties\".\nRECITALS\nA. The Receiving Party understands that the Disclosing Party has disclosed or may disclose information relating to Last Man Stands which to the extent previously, presently, or subsequently disclosed to the Receiving Party is hereinafter referred to as \"Proprietary Information\" of the Disclosing Party.\nOPERATIVE PROVISIONS\n1. In consideration of the disclosure of Proprietary Information by the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party hereby agrees: (i) to hold the Proprietary Information in strict confidence and to take all reasonable precautions to protect such Proprietary Information (including, without limitation, all precautions the Receiving Party employs with respect to its own confidential materials), (ii) not to disclose any such Proprietary Information or any information derived there from to any third person, (iii) not to make any use whatsoever at any time of such Proprietary Information except to evaluate internally its relationship with the Disclosing Party, and\n(iv) not to copy or reverse engineer any such Proprietary Information. The Receiving Party shall procure that its employees, agents and sub-contractors to whom Proprietary Information is disclosed or who have access to Proprietary Information sign a nondisclosure or similar agreement in content substantially similar to this Agreement. For a period of eighteen months following the execution of this agreement to the Receiving Party shall not, directly or indirectly hire, solicit, or encourage to leave the Disclosing Party employment, any employee, contractor or player of the Disclosing Party or hire any such employee or contractor who has left the Disclosing Parties employment, contractual engagement or player within one year of such employment or engagement, the Receiving Party. For a period of three years following the execution of this agreement, the contractor shall not start up his/her own cricket related business using the customer lists, trade secrets, inventions, innovations, processes, information, records and specifications of the Disclosing Party and/or used by the Disclosing party in connection with the operation of its business including, without limitation, the Disclosing parties business and product processes, methods, accounts and procedures.\n2. Without granting any right or license, the Disclosing Party agrees that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to any information after five years following the disclosure thereof or any information that the Receiving Party can document (i) is or becomes (through no improper action or inaction by the Receiving Party or any affiliate, agent, consultant or employee) generally available to the public, or (ii) was in its possession or known by it prior to receipt from the Disclosing Party as evidenced in writing, except to the extent that such information was unlawfully appropriated, or (iii) was rightfully disclosed to it by a third party, or (iv) was independently developed without use of any Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party. The Receiving Party may make disclosures required by law or court order provided the Receiving Party uses diligent reasonable efforts to limit disclosure and has allowed the Disclosing Party to seek a protective order.\n3. Immediately upon the written request by the Disclosing Party at any time, the Receiving Party will return to the Disclosing Party all Proprietary Information and all documents or media containing any such Proprietary Information and any and all copies or extracts thereof, save that where such Proprietary Information is a form incapable of return or has been copied or transcribed into another document, it shall be destroyed or erased, as appropriate.\n4. The Receiving Party understands that nothing herein (i) requires the disclosure of any Proprietary Information or (ii) requires the Disclosing Party to proceed with any transaction or relationship.\n5. The Receiving Party further acknowledges and agrees that no representation or warranty, express or implied, is or will be made, and no responsibility or liability is or will be accepted by the Disclosing Party, or by any of its respective directors, officers, employees, agents or advisers, as to, or in relation to, the accuracy of completeness of any Proprietary Information made available to the Receiving Party or its advisers; it is responsible for making its own evaluation of such Proprietary Information.\n6. The failure of either party to enforce its rights under this Agreement at any time for any period shall not be construed as a waiver of such rights. If any part, term or provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal or unenforceable neither the validity, nor enforceability of the remainder of this Agreement shall be affected. Neither Party shall assign or transfer all or any part of its rights under this Agreement without the consent of the other Party. This Agreement may not be amended for any other reason without the prior written agreement of both Parties. This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the Parties relating to the subject matter hereof unless any representation or warranty made about this Agreement was made fraudulently and, save as may be expressly referred to or referenced herein, supersedes all prior representations, writings, negotiations or understandings with respect hereto.\n7. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Disclosing Party is located (or if the Disclosing Party is based in more than one country, the country in which its headquarters are located) (the \"Territory\") and the parties agree to submit disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement to the non-exclusive of the courts in the Territory.\n[Receiving Party]\nSignature ___________________________\nName and Tile:_______________________\nAddress: ____________________________\n",

Definition of Confidential Information. For purposes of this Agreement, \"Confidential Information\" shall mean information disclosed by the disclosing party (the \"Disclosing Party\") to the receiving party (the \"Receiving Party\") which relates to product plans, designs, costs, prices and names, finances, marketing plans, business opportunities, research, development, know-how, or personnel, including confidential information disclosed by third parties and information relating to any type of technology; provided that information disclosed by the Disclosing Party will be considered Confidential Information by the Receiving Party only if such information is conspicuously designated as \"Confidential\" (i) in writing, if communicated in writing, or (ii) confirmed in writing within thirty (30) days of disclosure, if disclosed orally or in other non-tangible form; and provided further that Confidential Information shall not include information that (A) is now or subsequently becomes generally available to the public through no fault or breach on the part of the Receiving Party; (B) the Receiving Party can demonstrate to have had rightfully in its possession prior to disclosure to the Receiving Party by the Disclosing Party; (C) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without the use of any Confidential Information; or (D) the Receiving Party rightfully obtains from a third party who has the right to transfer or disclose it.\n2. Non-Disclosure and Non-Use of Confidential Information. The Receiving Party shall not, without the prior written approval of the Disclosing Party in each instance or unless otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement, use for its own benefit, publish or otherwise disclose to others, or permit the use by others for their benefit or to the detriment of the Disclosing Party, any of the Confidential Information. The Receiving Party shall carefully restrict access to the Confidential Information to those of its officers, directors and employees who clearly need such access in order to participate on behalf of the Receiving Party in the analysis and negotiation of a business relationship or any contract or agreement, or the advisability thereof, with the Disclosing Party and who are bound by written confidentiality agreements that protect third party information. The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information if required by a judicial or governmental request, requirement or order; provided that the Receiving Party will take reasonable steps to give the Disclosing Party sufficient prior notice of such request, requirement or order for the Disclosing Party to contest, limit or protect such disclosure.\n3. Ownership of Confidential Information. All Confidential Information and all intellectual property rights therein shall remain the property of the Disclosing Party and no license or other right to Confidential Information is granted or implied hereby.\n4. Term. The term of this Agreement is two (2) years from the Effective Date, provided that the Receiving Party's duty to protect the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information shall survive expiration or termination of this Agreement and shall expire five (2) years from the date of disclosure.\n5. Injunctive Relief. The Receiving Party understands and acknowledges that any disclosure or misappropriation of any of the Confidential Information in violation of this Agreement may cause the Disclosing Party irreparable harm, the amount of which may be difficult to ascertain and, therefore, agrees that the Disclosing Party shall have the right to apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for an order restraining any such further disclosure or misappropriation and for such other relief as the Disclosing Party shall deem appropriate, such right of the Disclosing Party to be in addition to the remedies otherwise available to the Disclosing Party at law or in equity.\n6. Return of Confidential Information. The Receiving Party shall immediately return to the Disclosing Party all written Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party and any and all records, notes and other written, printed or tangible materials pertaining to such Confidential Information upon receipt of a written request from the Disclosing Party. At the same time, the Receiving Party shall delete all copies of such records, notes and materials which are stored on its electronic memory devices.\n7. Binding on Successors. This Agreement and the Receiving Party's obligations hereunder shall be binding upon the representatives, assigns and successors of the Receiving Party and shall inure to the benefit of the assigns and successors of the Disclosing Party.\n8. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Minnesota.\n9. Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the sole understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and may not be amended or modified except in writing signed by each of the parties hereto.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have entered into this Agreement on the date set forth above and confirm that each has the authority to sign as or on behalf of their respective party.\nAnderson Cargo Services, Inc.

The parties wish to explore a business opportunity of mutual interest and in connection with this opportunity, each party may disclose to the other party certain confidential technical and business information which the disclosing party desires the receiving party to treat as confidential.\n\"Confidential Information\" means any information disclosed by either party to the other party, either directly or indirectly, in writing, orally or by inspection of tangible objects, including without limitation documents, prototypes, samples, plant and equipment, research, product plans, products, services, customer lists, software, developments, inventions, processes, designs, drawings, engineering, hardware configuration, marketing materials or finances, which is designated as \"Confidential,\" \"Proprietary\" or some similar designation. Information communicated orally shall be considered Confidential Information if such information is confirmed in writing as being Confidential Information within a reasonable time after the initial disclosure. Confidential Information may also include information disclosed to a disclosing party by third parties. Confidential Information shall not, however, include any information which (i) was publicly known and made generally available in the public domain prior to the time of disclosure by the disclosing party; (ii) becomes publicly known and made generally available after disclosure by the disclosing party to the receiving party through no action or inaction of the receiving party; (iii) is already in the possession of the receiving party at the time of disclosure by the disclosing party as shown by the receiving party's files and records immediately prior to the time of disclosure; (iv) is obtained by the receiving party from a third party without a breach of such third party's obligations of confidentiality; (v) is independently developed by the receiving party without use of or reference to the disclosing party's Confidential Information, as shown by documents and other competent evidence in the receiving party's possession; or (vi) is required by law to be disclosed by the receiving party, provided that the receiving party gives the disclosing party prompt written notice of such requirement prior to such disclosure and assistance in obtaining an order protecting the information from public disclosure.\nNon-use and Non-disclosure. Each party shall not use the Confidential Information of the other party for any purpose except to evaluate and engage in discussions concerning a potential business relationship between the parties. Neither party shall disclose any Confidential Information of the other party to third parties. If any party makes copies of the Confidential Information of the other party, such copies shall also constitute Confidential Information and any and all confidential markings on such documents shall be maintained. Neither party shall reverse engineer, disassemble or decompile any prototypes, software or other tangible objects which embody the other party's Confidential Information and which are provided to the party hereunder.\nMaintenance of Confidentiality. Each party shall take reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure and unauthorized use of the Confidential Information of the other party. Without limiting the foregoing, each party shall take at least those measures that it takes to protect its own most highly confidential information, and shall promptly notify the disclosing party of any misuse or misappropriation of Confidential Information of which it becomes aware. Each party shall disclose Confidential Information only to those officers, directors, employees and contractors who are required to have the information in order to evaluate or engage in discussions concerning the contemplated business relationship, and such party shall remain responsible for compliance with the terms of this Agreement by its officers, directors, employees and contractors.\nNo Obligation. Nothing herein shall obligate either party to proceed with any transaction between them, and each party reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate the discussions contemplated by this Agreement concerning the business opportunity.\nNo Warranty. ALL CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED \"AS IS.\" NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR OTHERWISE, REGARDING ITS ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS OR PERFORMANCE.\nPaid For Work. All paid for information, work, designs, ideas will become the property of the payor (the person or company paying).\nReturn of Materials. All documents and other tangible objects containing or representing Confidential Information which have been disclosed by either party to the other party, and all copies thereof which are in the possession of the other party, shall be and remain the property of the disclosing party and shall be promptly returned to the disclosing party upon the disclosing party's written request.\nNo License. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to grant any rights to either party under any patent, mask work right or copyright of the other party, nor shall this Agreement grant any party any rights in or to the Confidential Information of the other party except as expressly set forth herein.\nTerm. The obligations of each receiving party hereunder shall survive for a period of five years after the disclosure of the Confidential Information or until such time as all Confidential Information of the other party disclosed hereunder becomes publicly known and made generally available through no action or inaction of the receiving party, whichever is earlier. Parties agree to honor all patent protections.\nRemedies. Each party agrees that any violation or threatened violation of this Agreement may cause irreparable injury to the other party, entitling the other party to seek injunctive relief in addition to all legal remedies.\nChoice of Laws and Forum. The interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Florida, U.S.A., as it applies to a contract executed, delivered, and performed solely in such state. Both PARTIES agree that all disputes concerning the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement shall be heard by a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Florida, U.S.A. Furthermore, both PARTIES hereby consents to personal jurisdiction in the State of Florida, U.S.A., for any dispute arising out of a violation of this Agreement, or any attempt to recover losses incurred on such dispute.\nMiscellaneous. Neither party may assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party. Any attempted assignment in violation of this Section 11 will be null and void. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Florida, without reference to conflict of laws principles. This document contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and neither party shall have any obligation, express or implied by law, with respect to trade secret or proprietary information of the other party except as set forth herein. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement, or any of its terms or provisions, will not affect the validity of this Agreement as a whole, which will at all times remain in full force and effect. A failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver thereof or of any other provision. This Agreement may not be amended, nor any obligation waived, except by a writing signed by both parties hereto. Any notices required to be given under this agreement shall be deemed given upon the earlier of receipt of five (5) days after mailing by certified mail, return receipt requested, or hand delivery by messenger or express service, to the addresses stated on the first page, or to such other address as the either party may specify to the other in writing form time to time.\nProduct Development Experts, Inc. ____________________________________, Inventor\nBy: ________________________, President Signed:________________________________\nSigned: ______________________________ Print Name:____________________________\nDate; ________________________________ Title:__________________________________\n",

Return of Information\nUpon completion of the Business Purpose and/or upon written request of the party providing the Information, the other party shall within 14 days return all copies of the Information to the providing party or certify in writing that all copies of the Information have been destroyed. Nothing in this clause shall affect the right of either party voluntarily to return the Information, or any part thereof, to the other party at any time.\n3. No Warranty/Liability\nNeither party makes any warranty, express or implied, with respect to the Information. Neither party shall be liable to the other or to any other person hereunder for amounts representing loss of profits or loss of business or indirect, consequential or punitive damages of the other or of such other person in connection with the provision or use of the Information hereunder.\n4. No Further Rights\nNothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as granting or conferring any rights by licence or otherwise in the Information except as provided herein.\n5. Business Purpose\nThe parties expressly agree that the provision of Information hereunder and any discussions held in connection with the Business Purpose shall not prevent either party from pursuing similar discussions with third parties provided that no breach of this Agreement is so occasioned or oblige that party to take, continue or forego any action relating to the Business Purpose. Any forecasts or similar material provided by either party to the other shall not constitute any commitments.\n6. Injunctive Rights\nEach party acknowledges and agrees that the Information is the confidential and/or proprietary and/or trade secret information of the other and the unauthorised use or disclosure of the Information could cause irreparable harm and significant injury to the other party for which that other party would have no adequate remedy at law.

The term \u201cConfidential Information\u201d shall mean any confidential, proprietary, financial or otherwise non-public information, in written or electronic form, relating to the Disclosing Party, or the Purpose that is disclosed before, on or after the Effective Date, by the Disclosing Party to the Recipient or its affiliates, or to any of such Recipient\u2019s or its affiliates\u2019 employees, officers, directors, partners, shareholders, agents, attorneys, accountants or advisors (collectively, \u201cRepresentatives\u201d), whether disclosed or accessed in written, electronic or other form, including, without limitation: (a) information concerning the Disclosing Party\u2019s and its affiliates\u2019 business affairs, finances, forecasts, sales and other financial results, records and budgets, and business, marketing, development, sales and other commercial strategies; and (b) notes, analyses, compilations, reports, forecasts, data, statistics, summaries, interpretations and other materials prepared by or for Recipient or its Representatives that contain, are based on, or otherwise reflect or are derived, in whole or in part, from any of the foregoing. Confidential Information provided by Disclosing Party must be expressly marked or designated in writing by the Disclosing Party in a manner to indicate its confidential, proprietary or otherwise non-public nature.\n2. Recipient shall protect and safeguard the confidentiality of all such Confidential Information with at least the same degree of care as the Recipient would protect its own Confidential Information, but in no event with less than a commercially reasonable degree of care to protect and safeguard the confidentiality of all such Confidential Information.\n3. Recipient shall not, and shall cause its Representatives not to, (a) disclose all or any portion of Confidential Information to any third parties (other than to its Representatives who need to know the Confidential Information to assist Recipient in its evaluation of the Purpose), or (b) use or permit any Confidential Information to be accessed or used for any purpose other than for the evaluation of the Purpose. Recipient will be responsible for any breach of the terms of this Agreement caused by its Representatives. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Disclosing Party acknowledges and agrees that (a) the Recipient is expressly authorized to disclose the Confidential Information to certain lenders and investors, in furtherance of Recipient\u2019s performance of its obligations with respect to the Purpose and (b) under no circumstances will Recipient have any liability for any disclosure by such lenders or investors of any of the Confidential Information.\n4. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party, Recipient shall not disclose to any person or entity (other than its Representatives who are involved in its evaluation of the Purpose) any information with respect to the occurrence or content of any discussions or negotiations between the Parties.\n5. Recipient may disclose the Confidential Information in the event and to the extent Recipient reasonably believes any Confidential Information is required to be disclosed by Recipient under the terms of: (i) a valid and effective subpoena; (ii) a statute or regulation binding upon Recipient; (iii) an order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction; or (iv) by a demand or information request from an executive, regulatory or administrative agency or other governmental authority. Recipient shall endeavor to promptly notify the Disclosing Party of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such potential disclosure unless recipient reasonably believes that applicable law prohibits Recipient from informing the Disclosing Party of the potential disclosure.\n6. Recipient understands and agrees that neither the Disclosing Party nor any person or entity delivering the Confidential Information on behalf of Disclosing Party is making any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any information furnished or to be furnished by it to Recipient (any representation or warranty with respect thereto must be set forth or provided for in a definitive agreement between the parties, if any is entered into in connection with the Purpose or certification from Disclosing Party).\n7.

Recipient hereby further agrees that, in the event of its breach or threatened breach of this Agreement, the Disclosing Party would suffer irreparable harm and the Disclosing Party\u2019s remedies shall include, in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity, equitable remedies such as specific performance and injunctive relief and shall not be limited to monetary damages. Specifically, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek immediate injunctive relief prohibiting such violation.\n9. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as granting or conferring any rights by way of license or otherwise in or to any Confidential Information disclosed pursuant hereto. The disclosure or receipt of information pursuant hereto in no way obligates either Party to agree to any business transaction, whether or not relating to the Purpose.\n10. Neither Party may assign, transfer or sell any of its rights under this Agreement, or delegate any of its obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other Party. Each Party understands and agrees that no failure or delay by the other in exercising any of its rights or remedies hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any waiver in any instance constitute a waiver with respect to any other instance.\n11. Upon request of the Disclosing Party (which request may be made at any time upon reasonable notice), Recipient will destroy (or, if stored electronically, purge) or deliver to the Disclosing Party all copies of written Confidential Information (except for that portion of the Confidential Information that may be found in analysis, compilation, or other documents prepared by Recipient) in Recipient\u2019s possession. That portion of the Confidential Information that may be found in analysis, compilations and other documents prepared by Recipient will continue to be subject to the terms of this Agreement or shall be destroyed (or, if stored electronically, purged). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Recipient may retain copies of Confidential Information that it reasonably believes it is required to retain under applicable laws, banking regulations and internal policies of which relate to any services provided to the Disclosing Party. This Agreement shall terminate upon the earliest of (i) one (1) year from the date hereof, (ii) the date all Confidential Information is destroyed by Recipient or returned to the Disclosing Party, or (iii) upon the closing of any transaction between Recipient and the Disclosing Party for credit accommodations or banking services, at which time duties of confidentiality shall be determined by the transaction agreements and applicable law.\n12. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be in violation of applicable law, then such provision shall be void and the other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without regard to the principles of conflict of laws to the extent that such principles would permit or require the application of laws of another jurisdiction. Any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be brought in the federal or state courts located in New York, New York, and both Parties consent to jurisdiction and venue in such courts for purposes of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement.\n[SIGNATURE PAGE FOLLOWS]\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties hereto have executed, or caused to be executed by their duly authorized representatives, this Agreement as of Effective Date.\nDISCLOSING PARTY RECIPIENT\nMedia News Group, Inc.

Each party shall use its reasonable best e\ufb00orts to keep the other's Con\ufb01dential Information secret. Each party shall use at least the same degree of care to avoid unauthorized disclosure or use of the other's Con\ufb01dential Information as it employs with respect to its own Con\ufb01dential Information of like importance.\n2. Neither party has any obligation with respect to any Con\ufb01dential Information which (a) that party independently develops without reference to the Con\ufb01dential Information; (b) is or becomes publicly known without a breach of this Agreement by either party or is known prior to the date hereof; (c) is disclosed to it by a third person who is not required to maintain its con\ufb01dentiality; (d) is approved for release by the other party in writing. The party claiming any of the above exceptions has the burden of proving its applicability.\n3. Each party may disclose Con\ufb01dential Information only on a need-to-know basis to its own employees and to its consultants under appropriate written burden of con\ufb01dentiality. Each party shall take appropriate action with its employees and advisors to satisfy its obligations under this Agreement. Each party shall be responsible to the other for any violation of this Agreement by its own employees or consultants.\n4. Neither party may print or copy, in whole or in part, any documents or magnetic media containing any Con\ufb01dential Information without the prior written consent of the other party other than copies for employees or consultants who are working on the matter and have a need to know.\n5. Neither party may use the other's Con\ufb01dential Information for any purpose but the Business Purpose stated above.\n6. Each party's Con\ufb01dential Information shall remain its own property. Upon the termination of the business relationship or upon request, whichever is sooner, each party shall return all of the other's Con\ufb01dential Information, certifying destruction of any copies or partial copies made.\n7. The obligation of con\ufb01dentiality shall extend to three years from and including the date of return of the Con\ufb01dential Information and certi\ufb01cation of destruction of any copies made.

If either party becomes legally obligated, or receives a subpoena or other legal demand, to disclose any of the other party's Con\ufb01dential Information, the party subject to the obligation shall notify the other party in writing immediately, shall cooperate with the other party in seeking a prospective order or other appropriate remedy, and shall use its reasonable best e\ufb00orts to protect the con\ufb01dential and proprietary status of any disclosed Con\ufb01dential Information.\n9. Each party agrees that in the event of a breach or threatened breach by either party, including its agents, directors, or employees, of the provisions of this Agreement, the non-breaching party may have no adequate remedy in money damages and, accordingly, shall be entitled to an injunction against such breach, in addition to any other legal or equitable remedies available to it.\n10.

It is contemplated that to make such a determination, each party may disclose certain information to the other in confidence.\nNOW THEREFORE, in consideration of mutual promises and covenants contained in this Agreement and the disclosure of Confidential Information to each other, the parties to this Agreement agree as follows:\n1. Definition. The term \"Confidential Information\" as used herein means all trade secrets or confidential or proprietary information of either party, whether or not marked \u201cConfidential\u201d, whether in written or oral form, relating to such party's business or technology, including without limitation, its products, customer data, development and marketing plans, and financial information. In addition, Confidential Information shall include all terms and conditions of this Agreement including the fact that the parties are having discussions in order to determine the feasibility of a commercial relationship.\n2. Non-Disclosure of Confidential Information. The party receiving Confidential Information (the \u201cReceiving Party\u201d) shall not disclose Confidential Information to any third party without the prior written consent of the party disclosing such confidential information (the \u201cDisclosing Party\u201d) and shall restrict dissemination of Confidential Information within its own organization to those employees who have a need to have access to the Confidential Information. The Receiving Party agrees to protect Confidential Information by using the same degree of care as it would use to protect its own information of like importance, but in no case less than reasonable care. Any use of Confidential Information shall be solely for the purpose authorized above. Each party shall take appropriate measures, and in no event less than reasonable measures, by instruction and agreement prior to disclosure to such employees to assure against unauthorized use or disclosure. The Receiving Party agrees not to reverse engineer, disassemble, or otherwise restructure and/or copy or in any way recreate in whole or in part any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party.\n3.

Return or Destruction of Confidential Information. Upon written demand by the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall: (i) cease using the Confidential Information; (ii) promptly return the Confidential Information and all copies, notes or extracts thereof to the Disclosing Party within seven (7) days of receipt of demand; and/or (iii) upon request of the Disclosing Party, destroy all such Confidential Information, including copies thereof, and shall furnish the Disclosing Party with written certification of destruction.\n5.

Ownership and Disclaimer. Each party shall retain all right, title and interest to such party\u2019s Confidential Information disclosed to the other party. Subject only to the Receiving Party\u2019s limited use of the Confidential Information for the purpose set forth above, the Receiving Party acknowledges and agrees that nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as granting or implying any rights, license or otherwise, to any Confidential Information disclosed pursuant to this Agreement whether under any trademark, patent or copyright, or application of same which are now or thereafter may be obtained by such party. The Receiving Party shall not violate any of the Disclosing Party\u2019s intellectual property or other rights in or to the Confidential Information.\nALL CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED \u201cAS IS\u201d WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE DISCLOSING PARTY BE LIABLE FOR THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.\n7. Term.

General\n9.1 Severability. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable, and the invalidity or unenforceability of any one or more of the provisions herein shall not affect the validity or enforceability of other provisions herein.\n9.2 Choice of Laws. The laws of the State of YOUR COMPANY STATE shall govern the validity, construction and performance of this Agreement, provided, however, that no choice of law or rule of the State of YOUR COMPANY STATE, or any other jurisdiction, which would cause any such matter to be referred to the law of any jurisdiction other than YOUR COMPANY STATE shall be given any force or effect.

      "text": "NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nThis Nondisclosure Agreement (the \"Agreement\") is entered into by and between The National Archives, (the \"Disclosing Party\"), and _______________________, located at __________________ _________________________________________________ (the \"Receiving Party\"), for the purpose of preventing the unauthorised disclosure of Sensitive Information as defined below, in line with HMG\u2019s Security Policy Framework. The parties agree to enter into a confidential relationship with respect to the disclosure of certain sensitive, proprietary or protected information (\"Sensitive Information\").\n1. Definition of Sensitive Information. For purposes of this Agreement, \"Sensitive Information\" shall include all information or material that\n\uf0b7 has or could have commercial value or other utility in the business in which Disclosing Party is engaged\n\uf0b7 might lead to the security of the Disclosing Party\u2019s physical or information assets or the safety of its staff and customers being compromised.\nIf Sensitive Information is in a physical or electronic form, the Disclosing Party shall label or stamp the materials with the words OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE, or some similar warning, in line with HMG\u2019s protective marking scheme. If Sensitive Information is transmitted orally, the Disclosing Party shall promptly provide a writing indicating that such oral communication constituted Sensitive Information.\n2. Exclusions from Sensitive Information. Receiving Party's obligations under this Agreement do not extend to information that is: (a) publicly known at the time of disclosure or subsequently becomes publicly known through no fault of the Receiving Party; (b) discovered or created by the Receiving Party before disclosure by Disclosing Party; (c) learned by the Receiving Party through legitimate means other than from the Disclosing Party or Disclosing Party's representatives; (d) is disclosed by Receiving Party with Disclosing Party's prior written approval; or (e) independently developed by the Receiving Party outside the scope of this agreement.\n3. Obligations of Receiving Party. Receiving Party shall hold and maintain the Sensitive Information in strictest confidence for the sole and exclusive benefit of the Disclosing Party. Receiving Party shall carefully restrict access to Sensitive Information to employees, contractors and third parties as is reasonably required and shall require those persons to sign nondisclosure restrictions at least as protective as those in this Agreement. Receiving Party shall put in place effective governance controls to monitor compliance and respond to (and report) any security breach incidents. Receiving Party shall not, without prior written approval of Disclosing Party, use for Receiving Party's own benefit, publish, copy, or otherwise disclose to others, or permit the use by others for their benefit or to the detriment of Disclosing Party, any Sensitive Information. Receiving Party shall return to Disclosing Party any and all records, notes, and other written, printed, or tangible materials in its possession pertaining to Sensitive Information within a reasonable time period if Disclosing Party requests it in writing.\n4. Time Periods. The non-disclosure provisions of this Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement and Receiving Party's duty to hold Sensitive Information in confidence shall remain in effect until the Sensitive Information no longer qualifies as a trade secret or otherwise needing protection until Disclosing Party sends Receiving Party written notice releasing Receiving Party from this Agreement, whichever occurs first.\n5. Relationships. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute either party a partner, joint venture or employee of the other party for any purpose.\n6. Severability. If a court finds any provision of this Agreement invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement shall be interpreted so as best to effect the intent of the parties.\n7. Integration. This Agreement expresses the complete understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter and supersedes all prior proposals, agreements, representations and understandings. This Agreement may not be amended except in writing signed by both parties.\n8. Waiver. The failure to exercise any right provided in this Agreement shall not be a waiver of prior or subsequent rights.\nThis Agreement and each party's obligations shall be binding on the representatives, assigns and successors of such party. Each party has signed this Agreement through its authorised representative. __________________________________________________________________________ (Signature, on behalf of Disclosing Party)\nDate: _______________\n__________________________________________________________________________ (Signature, on behalf of Receiving Party)\n",

Confidentiality Policy\n1.1 The purpose of this agreement is to ensure that confidential matters brought before the Members of the Board of SAMED or any of its committees, are not disclosed until disclosure is properly authorized. SAMED Board and Committee members are in positions of trust towards SAMED as a voluntary membership organization, and such trust may require that elected and appointed persons act with the highest integrity and keep certain information confidential, and avoid conflicts of interest.\n1.2 This agreement is designed to provide clarity for each Board Member and Committee Member with regard to confidential matters that come before- or arise out of meetings and matters of the Members of the Board of SAMED or any of its committees, and provides certainty as to how situations of conflict of interest are to be handled.\n1.3 Its objective is to address matters of confidentiality in a manner that facilitates the Board, and Committees in maintaining the highest business and ethical standards, protects the integrity of SAMED, the Board, and Committees, allows for appropriate levels of transparency and accountability in matters before the Board, and supports the maintenance of effective relationships among Board Members, SAMED and Committee Members.\n2. Definitions\n2.1 \u201cAgreement\u201d means this Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement\n2.2 \"Board\" means the Board of SAMED.\n2.3 \u201cBoard Members\u201d means members of the Board.\n2.4 \u201cChair\u201d means Chair of the Board.\n2.5 \"Committee\" means a committee of the Board.\n2.6 \"Committee Members\" means members of any Committee.\n2.7 \"Meeting\" means a meeting of the Board or a Committee, as applicable.\n2.8 \"Policy\" means this Confidentiality Policy\n2.9 \u201cSAMED\u201d means South African Medical Devices Industry Association\n2.10 \u201cVice-Chair\u201d, means Vice-Chair of the Board\n3.

Confidentiality\n4.1 Regular Board meetings are, in the ordinary course of events, not open to the public and/or media.\na) Members of SAMED may on invitation attend Board meetings.\nb) Once the Board has dealt with an issue in a board meeting and has decided on that matter, the issue is considered to be accessible to members to the extent of that decision. Matters that are so declared may be accessible to the public at large to the extent so declared by the Board.\nc) All decisions that would be accessible to the general membership and/or the public at large will be recorded as such in the Board minutes.\nd) If no recordal is made, the matter, discussions and all resolutions should be deemed to be confidential unless declared by the Board by resolution as not confidential.\ne) When considering whether matters are confidential or not, the nature of SAMED as a membership organization, the prospects of harm to SAMED (including harm to its reputation, good processes and procedures and good governance), as well as the impact of any such decision on members or groups of members, must, amongst others, be considered.\n4.2 The Board also holds in-camera meetings, All present at any in-camera meeting will be bound to keep the proceedings confidential, unless otherwise directed by the Chairperson of the Board of Directors or any committee created by it with a support of the majority.

      "text": "NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nThe parties to this Agreement are MPD Technologies, Inc. (\"Disclosing Party\") and the undersigned \"Recipient\". The parties desire that Disclosing Party disclose certain Information or Items to Recipient, but Disclosing Party desires to maintain the trade secret, proprietary or private nature of such Information or Items.\nAs used herein, the following words have the indicated meanings:\n(i) \"Disclose\" means to reveal, make known, make available, furnish, or permit access to, whether or not intentionally.\n(ii) \"Information\" means all oral, written, or other information whatsoever, including information in documents and other recording media and information embodied in any item, which in connection with the Matter, is (a) obtained by Recipient from or through Disclosing Party, (b) obtained by or through Recipient by an examination of any Item, or (c) created by or through Recipient with the use of information in (a) or (b). It includes but is not limited to ideas, inventions, discoveries, formulas, methods, designs, drawings, specifications, engineering and manufacturing data. This information is limited to trade secrets and other proprietary or private information of Disclosing Party or of any third party if disclosed by or through Disclosing Party.\n(iii) \"Item\" means any system, subsystem, assembly, subassembly, device, components, product, or machine, work of authorship, or part thereof, or substance which is disclosed by or through Disclosing Party hereunder, which embodies trade secret or other proprietary or private information of Disclosing Party or of any third party if disclosed by or through Disclosing Party.\n(iv) \"Matter\" means the project or other matter in connection with which this Agreement is executed. This matter is or relates to the potential acquisition by the Recipient of a controlling ownership interest in the share capital or business of the Disclosing Party.\nThe parties to this Agreement have agreed as follows:\n1. Non-Disclosure. Recipient agrees as follows:\n1.1. For a period of three (3) years from the date of entering in to this Agreement, not to disclosure any Information or Item, in any manner whatsoever, directly or indirectly, whether in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of Disclosing Party, to any individual, firm or entity, excepting solely an individual who (a) is an officer, director or employee of Disclosing Party or of the Recipient and (b) has a clear need to know for purposes directly related to the Matter.\n2. Exclusions. The obligations of a Recipient under Section 1.1 hereof shall not apply to the following:\n2.1. Any Information which, at the time of disclosure, is already rightfully possessed by Recipient or is already in the public domain;\n2.2. Any Information which, after the disclosure, enters the public domain without any action or fault of Recipient.\n2.3. Any Information which is obtained, other than in connection with the Matter, from any individual, firm or entity which had the unrestricted right to disclose it;\n2.4. Any Information which is developed independently by Recipient without reference to any Information or Item;\n3. Non-Disclosure Agreements from Third Parties. If Disclosing Party gives its written consent to Recipient to disclose Information or Items to a third party, Recipient shall require the third party to execute a non-disclosure agreement in form, and substance satisfactory to Disclosing Party. Recipient shall promptly furnish Disclosing Party with a copy of all such non-disclosure agreements.\n4. Notification of Mandatory Disclosure by Recipient. In the event you are required by any legal or civil proceeding to disclose the Information or Items to a third party, you agree to provide prompt notice to the Disclosing Party, so that we might attempt to secure an appropriate protective order, or waive your compliance with this Agreement. You agree to cooperate with the Disclosing Party in its attempts to secure such a protective order.\n5. Only One Source of Discussion. You agree that you will only discuss the Matter with Mr. Al Weber, Chief Executive Officer, or Mr. Thomas V. Gilboy, Chief Financial Officer of the Disclosing Party. Under no circumstances will you discuss the Matter, or admit that the Matter has been a topic of discussion with any other employees of the Disclosing Party, or any other third party. In addition, during 2000, you agree not to undertake any unusual efforts to research the business, operations, prospects or finances of the Disclosing Party, where such research efforts would include discussions with any third party, except in the ordinary course of business.\n6. Employees. For a period of two (2) years Recipient (or any agent or affiliates of the Recipient) will not have discussions with any \"Covered Employees\" of the Disclosing Party regarding employment opportunities with the Recipient or any of its affiliates. \"Covered Employees\" will include any person who is employed by the recipient as a part or full time employee either as of the date of this Agreement, or persons that subsequently become employees of the Disclosing Party. However, if a person subsequently terminates their employment with the Disclosing Party, then the recipient can have such discussions with that person, after a 5-day waiting period. In addition, if the Recipient published a general posting for employment opportunities in any publication or web site, and one of the Recipient's Covered Employees should respond to the posting, then the Recipient will be free to have such discussions with that person.\n7. Survival. This Agreement shall survive the execution of any subsequent contract between the parties hereto, excepting solely if the subsequent contract relates to the Matter and expressly addresses Recipient's non-disclosure obligations with respect to the Matter.\n8. Preservation of Markings. Recipient shall not alter or delete any markings on any Information or Item restricting its disclosure, use or reproduction or indicating its proprietary or private status. Recipient shall include all such markings in all copies of any Information which it makes.\n9. No Proprietary Right; Return of Information or Items. Nothing herein shall confer upon Recipient any right, title, interest or license whatsoever in or to any Information or Items. At the end of our discussions regarding the Matter, the Disclosing Party has the right to request that the Recipient return all Information or Items to the Disclosing Party.\n10. No Obligations regarding any Transaction. Neither party is under any obligation to pursue or conclude a transaction in connection with the Matter. Both parties will bear their own expenses associated with discussions pertaining to the Matter.\n11. No Representations or Warranties. The Disclosing Party makes no representation or warranties of any nature regarding the accuracy or completeness of the Information or Items provided to the Recipient at this time.\n12. Injunction. In the event of any breach of this Agreement by either party, or any threatened or attempted breach by either party, the other party to this Agreement shall be entitled to an injunction against the breaching party. Nothing contained herein precludes the other party from pursuing any other remedies available hereunder or at law or equity for such breach, including the recovery of damages.\n13. General\n13.1. This agreement constitutes the entire, final and complete agreement between the parties relevant to the subject matter hereof, and it supersedes and replaces all written and oral agreements relevant to the subject matter made or existing by and between the parties or their representatives, and there shall be no modifications hereto unless it is in writing signed by the parties.\n13.2. Validity, interpretation, performance, remedies, and all other issues relating to this Agreement shall be governed by the internal law of the State of New York.\n13.3. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns.\nMPD TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

In connection with the Prospective Purchase, the Company will provide GSEnergy with certain proprietary and commercially sensitive information and develop further such information with GSEnergy (all of the foregoing hereinafter referred to as \"Information\") which it wishes GSEnergy to maintain as confidential. GSEnergy agrees that it will safeguard such Information maintaining it confidential and not using it except for the purposes of such review and analysis.\nThe term \"Information\" shall mean and includes all information in whatever form, provided for the purpose of GSEnergy's review and analysis, but is not information which:\n(a) is in the public domain at the time of disclosure to GSEnergy; or\n(b) enters the public domain after disclosure to GSEnergy, except where such entry is the result of a breach by GSEnergy of this Agreement; or\n(c) was already in the possession of GSEnergy prior to disclosure to GSEnergy and was not then subject to an obligation of confidence; or\n(d) is rightfully disclosed to GSEnergy by a third person.\n2. GSEnergy agrees to maintain all Information in secrecy and confidence for a period of seven (7) years from the date of disclosure thereof, using the same degree of care as is used to protect its own Information. In no event will this degree of care be less than a reasonable degree of care.\n3. If GSEnergy desires to use individuals not employed by GSEnergy, GSEnergy shall not disclose Information to these individuals without obtaining prior written approval from the Company and having appropriate non-disclosure agreements signed in form and substance satisfactory to the Company.\n4. It will not constitute a violation of this Agreement for GSEnergy to disclose Information as required by a governmental body or a court of competent jurisdiction or as otherwise required by law, provided that the Company has been given notice of such requirement and been afforded a reasonable opportunity to contest it, if applicable.\n5. If any provision of this Agreement is or becomes or is deemed invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such provision shall be deemed amended to conform to applicable laws so as to be valid and enforceable or, if it cannot be so amended without materially altering the intention of the parties, it shall be stricken, and the remainder of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.\n6. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n7. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original and all of which shall constitute together but one and the same document.\n8. All notices from GSEnergy hereunder shall be in writing and delivered to the attention of Mr. Michael J. Hager, New England Power Company, 25 Research Drive, Westborough, MA 01582. All notices from the Company hereunder shall be in writing and delivered to GSEnergy at the above address.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, GSEnergy and the Company have caused this Agreement to be executed by their authorized representatives.\nGRANITE STATE ENERGY, INC.\nBy: s/John H.

      "text": "MUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nThis Agreement, made as of this 27th day of September, 1999 (the \"Effective Date\") by and between Ben & Jerry's Homemade, Inc., a Vermont corporation headquartered at 30 Community Drive, South Burlington, Vermont 05403 (\"Ben & Jerry's\") and Conopco, Inc., with an address at 390 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10022 (collectively, the \"Company\"), sets forth the terms and conditions of the confidential disclosure of certain information between the parties. The party from time to time disclosing Confidential Information, as herein defined, shall be referred to as the \"Discloser\" with respect to such Confidential Information and the party from time to time receiving such Confidential Information shall be referred to as the \"Recipient\" with respect to such Confidential Information. The terms \"Ben & Jerry's Confidential Information\" and the \"Company's Confidential Information\" shall refer to the Confidential Information disclosed by Ben & Jerry's and the Company as Disclosers, respectively.\nIn consideration of the premises set forth below and other valuable consideration, the receipt of which in hereby acknowledged by each party, Ben & Jerry's and the Company agree as follows:\n1. \"Confidential Information\" shall mean all information disclosed to Recipient by Discloser or its agents or employees in any manner, whether orally, visually or in tangible form (including, without limitation, documents, devices and computer readable media) and all copies thereof, whether created by Discloser or Recipient. Tangible materials that disclose or embody Confidential Information shall be marked, to the extent practicable, by Discloser as \"Confidential,\" \"Proprietary\" or the substantial equivalent thereof.\n2. Except as expressly permitted herein, Recipient shall not disclose Confidential Information and shall prevent the disclosure of such information by Recipient or its affiliates and their respective employees, directors, counsel, advisors, agents and independent contractors (all of which collectively \"Representatives\") by using the same degree of care to keep confidential the Confidential Information as it uses to keep confidential its own confidential information. In addition, except as permitted herein, Recipient shall not disclose the fact that the parties are exchanging Confidential Information and having discussions. In connection therewith, it is agreed that no public release or disclosure of any contemplated transaction shall be made except by a mutually agreed disclosure except that each party may make such disclosure if advised by its outside securities counsel in writing that such disclosure is required; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in such event such party will notify the other party that it intends, as a preliminary matter, to take such action and the outside securities counsel of such party shall first discuss the mater with the outside securities counsel of the other party before any definitive decision is made on the disclosure.\n3. Recipients shall use Confidential Information solely for the purpose (the \"Permitted Purpose\") specified at the end of this Agreement.\n4. Recipient shall disclose Confidential Information only to those of its Representatives who have a need to know such information for the Permitted Purpose.\n5. Confidential Information shall not include any information that:\n(a) was in Recipient's or its Representative's possession prior to disclosure by Discloser hereunder;\n(b) was generally known, in the trade or business in which it is practiced by Recipient or its Representatives at the time of disclosure to Recipient or its Representatives hereunder, or becomes so generally known after such disclosure, through no act of Recipient or its employees, agents or independent contractors in violation of this Agreement;\n(c) has come into the possession of Recipient or its Representatives from a third party who is not, to Recipient's knowledge, under any obligation to Discloser to maintain the confidentiality of such information;\n(d) was developed by Recipient or its Representatives independently of and without reference to Confidential Information.\nIf a particular portion or aspect of Confidential Information becomes subject to any of the foregoing exceptions, all other portions or aspects of such information shall remain subject to all of the provisions of this Agreement.\n6. Recipient agrees not to reproduce or copy by any means Confidential Information, except as reasonably required to accomplish such Recipient's Permitted Purpose. Upon written demand by Discloser at any time, Recipient shall return promptly to Discloser or destroy, at Recipient's option, all tangible materials that disclose or embody Confidential Information except that Recipient's counsel may, upon written notice to Disclosure's counsel, retain a single copy of Confidential Information in its records solely for use in dispute resolution or as otherwise required by law. Recipient shall not remove any proprietary rights legend from, and shall, upon Discloser's reasonable written request, add an appropriate proprietary legend to, materials disclosing or embodying Confidential Information.\n7. In the event that Recipient is ordered to disclose Discloser's Confidential Information pursuant to a judicial or governmental request, requirement or order, Recipient shall promptly notify Discloser and take reasonable steps at Discloser's expense to assist Discloser in contesting such request, requirement or order or otherwise protecting Discloser's rights.\n8. Discloser understands that Recipient is an ice cream manufacturer and engaged in distribution (and with arrangements with distributors or subdistributors) and that planned activities in all such areas that are independently developed, pursued or acquired by the Recipient may contain ideas and concepts similar or identical to those contained in Discloser's Confidential Information. Discloser agrees that entering into this Agreement shall not preclude Recipient from developing, pursuing or acquiring projects similar to Discloser's, without obligation to Discloser, provided Recipient does not breach its obligations to Discloser under this Agreement or use the Confidential Information to develop or pursue such projects. The parties agree that unless and until a definitive written agreement between the Company and Ben & Jerry's has been executed and delivered relating to a specific transaction (which agreement contains customary conditions, representations, warranties and covenants for an agreement of that kind), neither party shall be under any obligation whatsoever with respect to such a transaction by virtue of this or any written or oral communication with respect to such a transaction by it or any of its respective Representatives.\n9. The rights and obligations herein shall bind the parties and their successors and assigns. This Agreement expresses the entire agreement and understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes al prior oral or written agreements, commitments and understandings pertaining to the subject matter hereof. Any modifications of or changes in this Agreement shall be in writing and signed by both parties. This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect for two years. Any causes of action accrued on or before the expiration of such period shall survive the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.\n10. This Agreement and any controversies, disputes or claims arising out of or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York and the parties agree to submit any and all such controversies, disputes, or claims to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts located in New York, New York.\nPERMITTED PURPOSES\nA. The \"Permitted Purpose\" with respect to Confidential Information disclosed to the Company shall be, to evaluate whether or not to enter into an agreement with Ben & Jerry's relating to a joint venture, other cooperative venture or the like between Ben & Jerry's and the Company.\nB. The \"Permitted Purpose\" with respect to Confidential Information disclosed to Ben & Jerry's shall be: to evaluate whether or not to enter into an agreement with the Company relating to a joint venture, other cooperative venture or the like between Ben & Jerry's and the Company.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, each party has caused this Agreement to be executed and delivered by its authorized officer.\nCONOPCO, INC., BEN & JERRY'S HOMEMADE, INC.,\nBy: /S/MART LAIUS By: /S/ PERRY D.

Morgan Securities Inc.\n60 Wall Street\nNew York, New York 10260\nDear Ms. Hitscherich:\nCarpenter Technology Corporation (\"we\", \"our\" or \"us\") has requested information regarding Talley Industries, Inc. (the \"Company\", \"your\" or \"you\") in connection with our consideration of the possible acquisition of the Company (a \"Possible Transaction\"). In consideration of your furnishing us with the Evaluation Materials (as defined below) we agree as follows:\nConfidentiality of Evaluation Materials\nWe will treat confidentially any information (whether written or oral) that either the Company or its financial advisor, J.P. Morgan & Co. Incorporated (\"JPM\"), or the Company's other representatives furnish to us in connection with a Possible Transaction involving the Company, together with analyses, compilations, studies or other documents prepared by us, or by our representatives (as defined below) which contain or otherwise reflect such information or our review of, or interest in, the Company (collectively, the \"Evaluation Materials\"). We recognize and acknowledge the competitive value of the Evaluation Materials and the damage that could result to the Company if the Evaluation Materials were used or disclosed except as authorized by this Agreement.\nThe term \"Evaluation Materials\" includes information furnished to us orally or in writing (whatever the form or storage medium) or gathered by inspection, and regardless of whether such information is specifically identified as \"confidential\". The term \"Evaluation Materials\" does not include information which (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by us or our representatives, (ii) was or becomes available to us on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Company or its representatives, provided that such source is not prohibited from disclosing such information to us by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation to the Company or its representatives, or (iii) is independently developed by us. Use of Evaluation Materials\nWe will not use any to the Evaluation Materials for any purpose other than the exclusive purpose of evaluating a Possible Transaction. We and our representatives will keep the Evaluation Materials completely confidential; provided, however, that (i) any of such information may be disclosed to those of our directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives (including attorneys, accountants and financial advisors), lenders and other sources of financing (collectively, \"our representatives\") who we reasonably determine need to know such information for the purpose of evaluating a Possible Transaction between us and the Company (it being understood that our representatives shall be informed by us of the confidential nature of such information and shall be directed by us, and shall each agree to treat such information confidentially) and (ii) any other disclosure of such information may only be made if the Company consents in writing prior to any such disclosure. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that a Possible Transaction is not consummated neither we nor our representatives shall use any of the Evaluation Materials for any purpose. We will be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by our representatives.\nIn the event that we or any of our representatives receive a request or are required (by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose all or any part of the Evaluation Materials, we or our representatives, as the case may be, agree to (i) immediately notify the Company of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such a request, (ii) consult with the Company on the advisability of taking legally available steps to resist or narrow such request and (iii) assist the Company in seeking a protective order or other appropriate remedy. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained or that the Company waives compliance with the provisions hereof, (i) we or our representatives, as the case may be, may disclose to any tribunal only that portion of the Evaluation Materials which we are advised by counsel is legally required to be disclosed, and shall exercise our best efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Evaluation Materials and (ii) we shall not be liable for such disclosure unless disclosure to any such tribunal was caused by or resulted from a previous disclosure by us or our representatives not permitted by this Agreement.\nNon-Disclosure\nThe disclosure of our possible interest in purchasing the Company could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business if for any reason an agreement of purchase and sale is not consummated. Accordingly, unless required by applicable law, we agree that prior to the execution of a Sale Agreement with respect to the closing of a Possible Transaction, without the prior written consent of the Company, we will not, and we will direct our representatives not to, disclose to any person either the fact that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning a possible transaction between us and the Company or any to the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any such Possible Transaction, including the status thereof unless we are advised by counsel that we are required to make such disclosure. The term \"person\" as used in this letter shall be broadly interpreted to include, without limitation, any corporation, the Company, governmental agency or body, stock exchange, partnership, association or individual.\nReturn of Documents\nUpon the Company's request, we shall promptly deliver to the Company or destroy all written Evaluation Materials and any other written materials without retaining, in whole or in part, any copies, extracts or other reproductions (whatever the form or storage medium) of such materials.\nNo Unauthorized Contact\nDuring the course of our evaluation, all inquiries and other communications are to be made directly to JPM or employees or representatives of the Company specified by JPM. Accordingly, we agree not to directly or indirectly contact or communicate with any executive or other employee of the Company concerning a Possible Transaction, or to seek any information in connection therewith from such person, without the express consent of JPM, with the exception of direct communication between our chairman and the Company's chairman. We also agree not to discuss with or offer to any third party an equity participation in a Possible Transaction or any other form of joint acquisition by us and such third party without JPM's prior written consent provided that the foregoing undertaking shall not prevent us from soliciting, on a confidential basis, indications of intent form selected third parties for the purchase of portions of the Company.\nFor a period of two years following the date hereof, you will not, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment or hire any officer, director, or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or divisions with whom you have had contact or who became known to you in connection with your consideration of the Possible Transaction, except that you shall not be precluded from hiring any such employee who (i) initiates discussions regarding such employment without any direct or indirect solicitation by you, (ii) responds to any public advertisement placed by you, or (iii) has been terminated by the Company or its subsidiaries prior to commencement of employment discussions between you and such officer, director, or employee.\nStandstill\nWe agree that until two years from the date of this Agreement, we will not without the prior approval of the Board of Directors of the Company (i) acquire or make any proposal to acquire any securities or property of the Company, (ii) propose to enter into any merger or business combination involving the Company or purchase a material portion of the assets of the Company, (iii) make or participate in any solicitation of proxies to vote, or seek to advise or influence any person with respect to the voting of any securities of the Company, (iv) form, join or participate in a \"group\" (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) with respect to any voting securities of the Company, (v) otherwise act or seek to control or influence the management, Board of Directors or policies of the Company, (vi) disclose any intention, plan or arrangement inconsistent with the foregoing or (vii) take any action which might require the Company to make a public announcement regarding the possibility of a business combination or merger. No Representation or Warranty\nAlthough the Company and JPM have endeavored to include in the Evaluation Materials information known to them which they believe to be relevant for the purpose of our investigation, we acknowledge and agree that none of the Company, JPM or any of the Company's other representatives or agents is making any representation or warranty, expressed or implied hereunder, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Materials, and none of the Company, JPM or any of the Company's other representatives or agents, nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives, stockholders, owners, affiliates, advisors or agents, will have any liability to us or any other person hereunder resulting from the use of Evaluation Materials by us or any of our representatives. Only those representations or warranties that are made to a purchaser in a definitive sale agreement for the Company (\"Sale Agreement\") when, as and if it is executed, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be specified in such Sale Agreement, will have any legal effect.\nWe also acknowledge and agree that no contract or agreement providing for the sale of the Company shall be deemed to exist between us and the Company unless and until a Sale Agreement has been executed and delivered by us and each of the other parties thereto, and we hereby waive, in advance, any claims (including, without limitation, breach of contract) in connection with the sale of the Company unless and until a Sale Agreement has been executed and delivered by us and each of the other parties thereto. We also agree that unless and until a Sale Agreement between the Company and us with respect to the acquisition of the Company has been executed and delivered by us and each of the other parties thereto, there shall not be any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to any such transaction by virtue of this agreement or any other written or oral expression with respect to such transaction except, in the case of this Agreement for the matters specifically agreed to herein. For purposes of this Agreement, the term \"Sale Agreement\" does not include an executed letter of intent or any other preliminary written agreement, nor does it include any oral acceptance of an offer or bid by us.\nNo Solicitation\nDuring the period from acceptance of this agreement until the earlier of (a) the execution of a definitive agreement or (b) the date that is 45 days after the date of such acceptance, the Company and the officers, directors, employees and other representatives of the Company including JPM shall not directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate, or encourage any offers or proposals for the acquisition of the Company, or of any of the capital stock or all, or substantially all, of the assets of the Company, from third parties (an \"Acquisition Proposal\"). The Company, may, however, participate in discussions or negotiations with, and provide confidential information to, a third party, if the Chairman of the Board of the Company determines in good faith, after receiving advice from the Company's financial advisor, that such third party has submitted a bona fide proposal or indication of interest that is, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal that is financially superior to the non-binding indication of interest contained in the letter of August 7, 1997 from Robert W. Cardy to Paul L. Foster, provided, however, that the Company agrees to inform us of the receipt of any such proposal.\nLegal Remedy\nWe understand and agree that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by us or our representatives and that the Company will be entitled to specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies for any such breach. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Agreement by us or our representatives but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity.\nOther\nThis Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto regarding the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may be changed only by a written agreement signed by the parties hereto or their authorized representatives.\nThis Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to the conflicts of law principles thereof.\nIf you are in agreement with the foregoing, please sign and return one copy of this letter, it being understood that all counterpart copies will constitute but one agreement with respect to the subject matter of this letter.\nVery truly yours,\nCARPENTER TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION\nBy: /s/ G.

      "text": "MUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nEach undersigned party (the \"Receiving Party\") understands that the other party (the \"Disclosing Party\") has disclosed or may disclose information relating to the Disclosing Party's business particularly relating to uniform informer libraries, chemi-informatic tools and the nature of chemical libraries (including, with limitation, names and expertise of employees and consultants, know-how, formulas, processes, ideas, inventions (whether patentable or not), schematics, computer programs, software code, algorithms, development tools, manufacturing capability or processes, chemical routes, chemical structures, relationships with other businesses, business plans, and other technical, business, financial, customer and product development plans, forecasts, strategies and information), which to the extent previously, presently, or subsequently disclosed to the Receiving Party is hereinafter referred to as \"Proprietary Information\" of the Disclosing Party. Proprietary Information also includes any information which the Disclosing Party has received from a third party which the Disclosing Party is obligated to treat as confidential or proprietary.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, nothing will be considered \"Proprietary Information\" of the Disclosing Party unless either (1) it is first disclosed in tangible form and is conspicuously marked \"Confidential\", \"Proprietary\" or the like or (2) it is first disclosed in non-tangible form and orally identified as confidential at the time of disclosure and is summarized in tangible form conspicuously marked \"Confidential\" within thirty (30) days of the original disclosure.\nIn consideration of and solely for the purpose of the parties' discussion regarding a possible business transaction and any access the Receiving Party may have to Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party, each party (as the Receiving Party) hereby agrees as follows:\n1. Non-Disclosure and Non-Use Obligations. The Receiving Party agrees (i) to hold the Disclosing Party's Proprietary Information in strict confidence and to take all reasonable precautions to protect such Proprietary Information (including, without limitation, all precautions the Receiving Party employs with respect to its most confidential materials), (ii) not to divulge any such Proprietary Information or any information derived therefrom to any third person (except consultants or agents, subject to the conditions stated below), (iii) not to make any use whatsoever at any time of such Proprietary Information except to evaluate internally whether to enter into a proposed business transaction with the Disclosing Party without the prior written permission of the disclosing party, (iv) not to remove or export from the United States or re-export any such Proprietary Information or any direct product thereof except in compliance with all licenses and approvals required under applicable export laws and regulations, including without limitation, those of the U.S. Department of Commerce, and (v) not to copy or reverse engineer any such Proprietary Information. Any employee, consultant or agent given access to any such Proprietary Information must have a legitimate \"need to know\" and shall be similarly bound in writing. The parties shall be entitled to exchange Proprietary Information under the terms of this Agreement for a period not to exceed two (2) years from the date hereof, unless otherwise extended by mutual written agreement of the parties or incorporated into a separate agreement. Without granting any right or license, the Disclosing Party agrees that the foregoing clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (v) shall not apply with respect to all obligations after five (5) years following the disclosure thereof or any information that the Receiving Party can document (i) is or (through no improper action or inaction by the Receiving Party or any agent, consultant or employee) becomes generally known to the public, (i) was in its possession or the possession of an affiliate or consultant or known by it prior to receipt from the Disclosing Party, (iii) was rightfully disclosed to it, an affiliate or a consultant by a third party without restriction, or (iv) was independently developed without use of any Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party by employees of the Receiving Party who can be demonstrated to have had no access to such information. The Receiving Party may make disclosures required by court order provided the Receiving Party uses diligent efforts to limit disclosure and to obtain confidential treatment or a protective order and has allowed the Disclosing Party to participate in the proceeding.\n2. Patent or Copyright Infringement. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to grant any rights under any patent or copyright of the Disclosing Party, nor shall this Agreement grant the Receiving Party any rights in or to the Disclosing Party's Proprietary Information, except the limited right to review such Proprietary Information solely for the purpose of evaluating a possible business transaction.\n3. Return of Materials. Immediately upon (i) the decision by either party not to enter into a relationship as a result of the exchange of information hereunder, or (ii) a request by the Disclosing Party at any time, the Receiving Party will turn over to the Disclosing Party all Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party and all documents or media containing any such Proprietary Information and any and all copies or extracts or derivatives thereof to the extent it is requested by either party in writing, except that a single copy may be retained for legal archival purposes, subject to protection and non-disclosure in accordance with the term of this agreement. The Receiving Party understands that nothing herein (i) requires the disclosure of any Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party, which shall be disclosed if at all solely at the option of the Disclosing Party, or (ii) requires the Disclosing Party to proceed with any proposed transaction or relationship in connection with which Proprietary Information may be disclosed.\n4. No Publicity. Except to the extent required by law, neither party shall disclose the existence or subject matter of the negotiations or business relationship contemplated by this Agreement.\n5. Securities Law Considerations. Each party is aware, and will advise its employees, consultants and agents who are informed of the matters that are the subject of this agreement, of the restrictions imposed by the United States securities laws on the purchase and sale of securities by any person who has received material, non-public information from the issuer of such securities and on the communication of such information to any other person when it is reasonably foreseeable that such other person is likely to purchase or sell such securities in reliance upon such information.\n6. Miscellaneous. The Receiving Party acknowledges and agrees that due to the unique nature of the Disclosing Party's Proprietary Information, there can be no adequate remedy at law for any breach of its obligations hereunder, that any such breach may allow the Receiving Party or third parties to unfairly compete with the Disclosing Party resulting in irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party, and therefore, that upon any such breach or any threat thereof, the Disclosing Party may seek appropriate equitable relief (without the need to post bond or other security) in addition to whatever remedies it might have at law. The Receiving Party will notify the Disclosing Party in writing immediately upon the occurrence of any such unauthorized release or other breach of which it is aware. In the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be to any extent illegal, invalid or unenforceable, such provisions shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to principles of conflicts of law. The parties agree that any dispute regarding the interpretation or validity of this Agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in and for the County of San Diego, California, and each party hereby agrees to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts. This Agreement supersedes all prior discussions and writings and constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended except in an express writing signed by officers of both parties. No waiver or modification of this Agreement will be binding upon either party unless made in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of such party and no failure or delay in enforcing any right will be deemed a waiver.\nEach party warrants to the other that it is duly authorized to enter into this Agreement and that the terms of this Agreement are not inconsistent with any of its respective outstanding contractual obligations. The execution and performance of this Agreement does not obligate the parties to enter into any other agreement or to perform any obligations other than as specified herein.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the day and year set forth below.\nDate: 3-10-99\nCOMBICHEM, INC., DUPONT PHARMACEUTICALS COMPANY,\na Delaware corporation a Delaware general partnership\nBy: /s/ Vicente Anido, Jr. By: /s/ David S.

      "text": "CONFIDENTIALITY, NON-DISCLOSURE AND RESTRICTIVE COVENANT AGREEMENT\nThis Confidentiality, Non-Disclosure and Restrictive Covenant Agreement, dated as of this 30th day of August, 2005 (this \"Agreement\"), by and among (i) Hittite Microwave Corporation, a Delaware corporation (\"Hittite\"), (ii) HMC Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hittite, (\"Buyer\" and, together with Hittite, the \"Buyer Parties\"), (iii) Simtek Corporation, a Colorado corporation (\"Simtek\") and (iv) Q-Dot, Inc., an Illinois corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Simtek, (the \"Company\" and, together with Simtek, the \"Seller Parties\").\nWHEREAS, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of the date hereof by and among the Buyer Parties and the Seller Parties, the Buyer Parties have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to acquire substantially all the assets of the Company (the \"Acquisition\");\nWHEREAS, in partial consideration of the payment of the Purchase Price (as defined at Section 1.7 of the Asset Purchase Agreement) of the Acquisition and in accordance with Sections 4.4 and 6.9 of the Asset Purchase Agreement, Seller Parties agree to enter into this Agreement;\nWHEREAS, the Seller Parties acknowledge that the covenants of the Seller Parties set forth in this Agreement are an essential element of the Acquisition and that, but for this Agreement, Buyer Parties would not have entered into the Asset Purchase Agreement; and\nWHEREAS, the Seller Parties possess substantial and intimate knowledge of the business and affairs of the Company and its policies, methods, personnel and operations;\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:\n1. Non-Competition. For a period of four years from the date of this Agreement (the \"Restricted Period\"), Seller Parties shall not, directly or indirectly, engage in The Company's Business (as hereinafter defined) or, without the prior written consent of Buyer Parties, directly or indirectly, own an interest in, manage, operate, join, control, lend money or render financial or other assistance to or participate in, as a partner, stockholder, consultant or otherwise, any Person that competes with The Company's Business as it is conducted as of the Closing Date. For purposes of this Agreement, the term the \"The Company's Business\" shall mean any business anywhere in the world that provides products or services of the kind provided by the Business (as defined in the Recitals of the Asset Purchase Agreement) as of the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the purposes of this Section 1, ownership of securities having no more than one percent (1%) of the outstanding voting power of any competitor which are listed on any national securities exchange, automated securities exchange (including Nasdaq) or traded actively in the national over-the-counter market (in each case including any foreign equivalent) shall not be deemed to be in violation of this Agreement.\n2. Confidentiality. During the Restricted Period and at all times thereafter, Seller Parties will keep and hold all Confidential Information (as hereinafter defined) in strict confidence, and will not use or disclose in any way any of such Confidential Information without the prior express written consent of the Buyer Parties. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term \"Confidential Information\" shall mean all trade secrets and confidential or proprietary information (and any tangible representation thereof) owned, possessed or used in connection with The Company Business or by the Buyer Parties and its Affiliates; provided, however, that \"Confidential Information\" does not include information which is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by a Seller Party..\n3. Non-Solicitation. During the Restricted Period, Seller Parties agree that they will not in any way, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of conducting or engaging in any business that competes with The Company Business, call upon, solicit, advise or otherwise do, or attempt to do, business with any customers of the Company engaged prior to the Closing Date (provided that Simtek shall have the right to do business with any of its current or former customers), or interfere with or attempt to interfere with any officers, employees or consultants of the Buyer Parties, induce or attempt to induce any of them to leave the employ of the Buyer Parties or violate the terms of their Contracts, or any employment arrangements, with Buyer Parties, or, without the prior written consent of Buyer Parties, directly or indirectly, solicit to hire, hire or employ, whether as an employee, director, contractor, consultant or otherwise any officers, employees or consultants of the Buyer Parties, unless such Person's employment is terminated by the Seller Parties or its Affiliate; provided, however, that this Section 3 shall not prohibit general solicitations of or advertisements for employment by the Seller Parties that are not generally directed at any officers, employees, representatives or agents of the Buyer Parties, so long as the Seller Parties do not hire any such Person who responds to any such general solicitation or advertisement.\n4. Certain Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement, (a) the term \"Person\" shall mean an individual, a corporation, an association, a partnership, an estate, a trust and any other entity or organization, (b) the term \"Affiliate\" shall mean with respect to any Person, any Person which, directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, such Person, and (c) the term \"control\" (including, with correlative meaning, the terms \"controlled by\" and \"under common control with\"), as used with respect to any Person, means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of such Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.\n5. Extension of Restricted Period. The Restricted Period shall be extended by the length of any period during which the Seller Parties are in breach of the terms of this Agreement.\n6. Amendments and Supplements. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented by the parties hereto in any manner, except by an instrument in writing signed by the Seller Parties and the Buyer Parties.\n7. No Waiver. The terms and conditions of this Agreement may be waived only by a written instrument signed by the party waiving compliance. The failure of any party hereto to enforce at any time any of the provisions of this Agreement shall in no way be construed to be a waiver of any such provision, nor in any way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part hereof or the right of such party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No waiver of any breach of or non-compliance with this Agreement shall be held to be a waiver of any other or subsequent breach or non-compliance. The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that any party may otherwise have at law or in equity.\n8. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the substantive laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its principles of conflicts of laws.\n9. Notice. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered by hand, sent by facsimile transmission with confirmation of receipt, sent via a reputable overnight courier service with confirmation of receipt requested, or mailed by registered or certified mail (postage prepaid and return receipt requested) to the parties at the following addresses (or at such other address for a party as shall be specified by like notice), and shall be deemed given on the date on which delivered by hand or otherwise on the date of receipt as confirmed:\nIf to Buyer or Hittite:\nHittite Microwave Corporation\n20 Alpha Road\nChelmsford, MA 01824\nAttention: William W.

Construction of Agreement. A reference to a Section shall mean a Section in this Agreement unless otherwise expressly stated. The titles and headings herein are for reference purposes only and shall not in any manner limit the construction of this Agreement which shall be considered as a whole. The words \"include,\" \"includes\" and \"including\" when used herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words \"without limitation.\"\n11. Entire Agreement, Assignability, etc. This Agreement and the Asset Purchase Agreement and the documents and other agreements among the parties hereto and thereto as contemplated by or referred to herein or therein constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. This Agreement is not intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, except as otherwise expressly provided herein and shall not be assignable by operation of law or otherwise.\n12. Validity. The Seller Parties have independently consulted with their counsel and after such consultation agree that the covenants set forth in this Agreement are reasonable and proper. In the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be determined to be unenforceable by reason of its extension for too great a period of time or over too large a geographic area or over too great a range of activities, it shall be interpreted to extend only over the maximum period of time, geographic area or range of activities as to which it may be enforceable. If, after application of the preceding sentence, any provision of this Agreement shall be determined to be invalid, illegal or otherwise unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of the other provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 12, any invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision of this Agreement shall be severable, and after any such severance, all other provisions hereof shall remain in full force and effect.\n13. Remedies. Seller Parties recognize that money damages alone would not adequately compensate Buyer Parties and its Affiliates in the event of breach by Seller Parties of this Agreement, and Seller Parties therefore agree that, in addition to all other remedies available to Buyer Parties and its Affiliates, at law, in equity or otherwise, Buyer Parties and its Affiliates shall be entitled to injunctive relief for the enforcement hereof. All rights and remedies hereunder are cumulative and are in addition to and not exclusive of any other rights and remedies available, at law, in equity, by agreement or otherwise.\n14. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which together shall constitute one and the same Agreement.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Agreement to be executed as an agreement under seal as of the date first written above.\nSimtek Corporation\nBy: /s/Harold A.

      "text": "NON-COMPETITION AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nThis Non-Competition and Non-Disclosure Agreement (the \"Agreement\") is made and entered into this 30th day of May, 2001 by and between Hai-Perng, aka Alex Kuo (\"Covenantor\"), and Vertel Corporation, a California corporation (\"Buyer\"), and is made with reference to the following:\nRECITALS\nA. The Company is engaged in the business of development and sales of network management software tools that utilize CORBA as the development platform and provides consulting and related services. The Company has offices in California, New Jersey and Texas.\nB. Pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Reorganization and Liquidation, dated May 30, 2001, by and between Trigon Technology Group, Inc., a Texas corporation (the \"Company\"), and Buyer (the \"Purchase Agreement\"), the Company will sell to Buyer and Buyer will purchase from the Company, substantially all of the assets of the Company together with the goodwill of the Company (the \"Assets\").\nB. Covenantor is a shareholder of the Company and has been employed as the Chief Executive Officer and the President of the Company.\nC. Covenantor acknowledges that the Company and its employees and shareholders have over several years devoted substantial time, effort and resources to developing the Assets which consist of the Company's trade secrets and its other confidential and proprietary information as well as the Company's relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and others doing business with the Company; that such relationships, trade secrets and other information are vital to the successful conduct of the Company's business by Buyer in the future; that because of Covenantor's access to such confidential information and trade secrets, Covenantor would be in a unique position to divert business from Buyer and to commit irreparable damage to Buyer were Covenantor to be allowed to compete with Buyer or to commit any of the other acts prohibited below; that the enforcement of said restrictive covenants against Covenantor would not impose any undue burden upon Covenantor; that none of said restrictive covenants is unreasonable as to period or geographic area; and that the ability to enforce said restrictive covenants against Covenantor is a material inducement to the decision of Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated in the Purchase Agreement.\nNOW, THEREFORE in consideration of the foregoing recitals, the mutual agreements hereinafter set forth and the mutual benefits to be derived therefrom, Covenantor covenants and agrees as follows:\nARTICLE 1\nDEFINITIONS\n1.1 The term \"Buyer,\" as used herein, means not only Vertel Corporation, but also any company, partnership or entity which (a) directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled by or is under common control with Vertel Corporation or (b) is a successor-in-interest to Vertel Corporation.\n1.2 The term \"Confidential Information\", as used herein, means all information or material not generally known by non-Company personnel constituting Assets and acquired by Buyer under the Purchase Agreement which (i) gives the Company some competitive business advantage or the opportunity of obtaining such advantage or the disclosure of which could be detrimental to the interests of the Company; (ii) which is owned by the Company or in which the Company has an interest and (iii) which is either (A) marked \"Confidential Information,\" \"Proprietary Information\" or other similar marking, (B) known by Covenantor to be considered confidential and proprietary by the Company as of the date hereof or (C) from all the relevant circumstances should reasonably be assumed by Covenantor to be confidential and proprietary to the Company. Confidential Information includes, but is not limited to, the following types of information and other information of a similar nature (whether or not reduced to writing): trade secrets, inventions, drawings, file data, documentation, diagrams, specifications, know how, processes, formulas, models, flow charts, software in various stages of development, source code, object code, research and development procedures, research or development and test results, marketing techniques and materials, marketing and development plans, price lists, pricing policies, business plans, information relating to customers and/or suppliers' identities, characteristics and agreements, financial information and projections, and employee files. Confidential Information also includes any information described above which the Company obtains from another party and which the Company treats as proprietary or is required to treat as Confidential Information, whether or not owned or developed by the Company. NOTWITHSTANDING THE ABOVE, HOWEVER, NO INFORMATION CONSTITUTES CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IF IT IS GENERIC INFORMATION OR GENERAL KNOWLEDGE WHICH COVENANTOR WOULD HAVE LEARNED IN\nTHE COURSE OF SIMILAR EMPLOYMENT ELSEWHERE IN THE TRADE, IF SUCH INFORMATION IS\nLAWFULLY AVAILABLE TO COVENANTOR FROM A SOURCE OTHER THAN THE COMPANY, OR IF IT\nIS OTHERWISE PUBLICLY KNOWN AND IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\n1.3 The term \"Closing\" shall have the meaning ascribed to it in the Purchase Agreement.\nARTICLE 2\nCOVENANT NOT TO COMPETE\nCovenantor shall not at any time within the period commencing on the date hereof and ending on the fourth (4/th/) anniversary of the date hereof (the \"Restricted Period\"), have any\nownership interest (of record or beneficial) in or have any interest as an employee, salesman, consultant, officer or director in, or otherwise aid or assist in any manner, any firm, corporation, limited liability company, partnership, proprietorship or other business that engages in any California county, or in any other state, country or geographic area, listed in Exhibit \"A\" hereof in a business that is similar to and directly or indirectly offers products or services in competition with the business in which the Company was engaged in such California county, state, country or other geographic area as of the Closing, so long as Buyer, or any successor in interest of Buyer to the business and goodwill of the Company, remains engaged in such business in any such California county, state, country or other geographic area or continues to solicit customers or potential customers therein; provided, however, that Covenantor may own, directly or indirectly, solely as an investment, the securities of any person which are traded on any national securities exchange if Covenantor (i) is not a controlling person of, or a member of a group which controls, such person or (ii) does not, directly or indirectly own two percent (2%) or more of any class of securities of such person. For purposes of this ARTICLE 2, the business activities which may not be engaged in during the Restricted Period by Covenantor or by any firm, corporation, limited liability company, partnership, proprietorship or other business in which Covenantor has any interest are more particularly described in Exhibit \"B\" hereof.\nARTICLE 3\nSOLICITATION OF BUSINESS\nDuring the Restricted Period, Covenantor shall not solicit or assist any other person to solicit any business (other than for Buyer) from any present or past customer of the Company; or request or advise any present or future customer of the Company to withdraw, curtail or cancel its business dealings with Buyer; or commit any other act or assist others to commit any other act which might injure the business of Buyer.\nARTICLE 4\nEMPLOYEES\nDuring the Restricted Period, Covenantor shall not directly or indirectly (i) solicit or encourage any employee of Buyer to leave the employ of Buyer or (ii) hire any employee who has left the employ of Buyer if such hiring is proposed to occur within one year after the termination of such employee's employment with Buyer.\nARTICLE 5\nCONSULTANTS\nDuring the Restricted Period, Covenantor shall not directly or indirectly solicit or encourage any consultant then under contract with Buyer to cease work for Buyer.\nARTICLE 6\nNONDISCLOSURE\nFrom and after the Closing, Covenantor shall not (nor will Covenantor assist any other person to do so) directly or indirectly reveal, report, publish or disclose the Confidential Information to any person, firm or corporation not expressly authorized by Buyer to receive such Confidential Information, or use (or assist any person to use) such Confidential Information except for the benefit of Buyer.\nARTICLE 7\nOWNERSHIP AND RETURN OF MATERIALS\nUpon the termination of Covenantor's employment with Buyer, Covenantor shall immediately surrender to Buyer all notes, data, sketches, drawings, manuals, documents, records, data bases, programs, blueprints, memoranda, specifications, customer lists, financial reports, equipment and all other physical forms of expression incorporating or containing any Confidential Information, it being distinctly understood that all such writings, physical forms of expression and other things are the exclusive property of Buyer. Covenantor acknowledges that the unauthorized taking of any of Buyer's trade secrets is a crime under California Penal Code section 499(c) and is punishable by imprisonment in a state prison or in a county jail for a time not exceeding one year, or by a fine not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000), or by both such fine and such imprisonment. Covenantor further acknowledges that such unauthorized taking of Buyer's trade secrets could also result in civil liability under California Civil Code Section 3426, and that willful misappropriation may result in an award against Covenantor for triple the amount of Buyer's damages and Buyer's attorneys fees in collecting such damages.\nARTICLE 8\nRIGHTS AND REMEDIES UPON BREACH\nIf Covenantor breaches, or threatens to commit a breach of, any of the provisions of this Agreement (the \"Restrictive Covenants\"), Buyer shall have the following rights and remedies, each of which shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights and remedies available to Buyer under law or in equity:\n8.1 Specific Performance. The right and remedy to have the Restrictive Covenants specifically enforced or to have any actual or threatened breach thereof enjoined by any court having equity jurisdiction, all without the need to post a bond or any other security or to prove any amount of actual damage or that money damages would not provide an adequate remedy, it being acknowledged and agreed that any such breach or threatened breach will cause irreparable injury to Buyer and that monetary damages will not provide an adequate remedy to Buyer; and\n8.2 Accounting and Indemnification. The right and remedy to require Covenantor (i) to account for and pay over to Buyer all compensation, profits, monies, accruals, increments or other benefits derived or received by Covenantor or any associated party deriving such benefits as a result of any such breach of the Restrictive Covenants; and (ii) to indemnify Buyer against any other losses, damages (including special and consequential damages), costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs, which may be incurred by them and which result from or arise out of any such breach or threatened breach of the Restrictive Covenants.\nARTICLE 9\nSEVERABILITY OF COVENANTS/BLUE PENCILLING\nThe Restrictive Covenants shall be subject to Section 12.7 hereof and Covenantor hereby waives any and all right to attack the validity of the Restrictive Covenants on the grounds of the breadth of their geographic scope or the length of their term.\nARTICLE 10\nENFORCEABILITY IN JURISDICTIONS\nBuyer and Covenantor intend to and do hereby confer jurisdiction to enforce the Restrictive Covenants upon the courts of any jurisdiction within the geographical scope of such covenants. If the courts of any one or more of such jurisdictions hold the Restrictive Covenants wholly unenforceable by reason of the breadth of such scope or otherwise, it is the intention of Buyer and Covenantor that such determination not bar or in any way affect the right of Buyer to the relief provided above in the courts of any other jurisdiction within the geographical scope of such covenants, as to breaches of such covenants in such other respective jurisdictions, such covenants as they relate to each jurisdiction being, for this purpose, severable into diverse and independent covenants.\nARTICLE 11\nATTORNEYS' FEES\nIn the event of any action, suit, or other proceeding concerning the negotiation, interpretation, validity, performance, or breach of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall recover all of such party's reasonable attorneys' fees, expenses, and costs, not limited to costs of suit, incurred in each and every such action, suit, or other proceeding, including any and all appeals or petitions relating thereto.\nARTICLE 12\nMISCELLANEOUS\n12.1 Modification.

All notices, requests and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be delivered by courier or other means of personal service (including by means of a nationally recognized courier service or professional messenger service), or sent by facsimile or mailed first class, postage prepaid, by certified mail, return receipt requested, in all cases, addressed to:\nBuyer:\nVertel Corporation\n21300 Victory Boulevard Suite 700 Woodland Hills, California 91367\nAttention: Chief Executive Officer\nFax No.: (818) 598-0104\nWith a copy to:\nDavid J.

Unless the Participant indicates that this Agreement shall apply only to a specific division or location, this Agreement shall apply to the Participant's entire company.\nTHE PARTIES AGREE AS FOLLOWS:\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION TRANSMITTAL FORM. The confidential, proprietary and trade secret information of the disclosing party (hereinafter \"Confidential Information\") provided hereunder, is that information described in the Confidential Information Transmittal Record (CITR) form executed from time to time hereafter. CITR's are subject to the terms of this Agreement and shall be executed by the parties prior to the disclosure of Confidential Information. All information described in a CITR and marked with a \"confidential,\" \"proprietary,\" or similar legend shall be deemed Confidential Information. All Confidential Information received from the disclosing party shall be in tangible form. The CITR shall set forth the disclosing party, a description of the Confidential Information disclosed, the names of the representatives of the parties and the date when the disclosure covered by the CITR commenced.\nOBLIGATIONS OF RECEIVING PARTY. The receiving party shall not disclose Confidential Information to any third party without the prior written approval of the disclosing party. The receiving party shall maintain the Confidential Information with at least the same degree of care that the receiving party uses to protect its own similar categories of confidential and proprietary information, but no less than a reasonable degree of care under the circumstances. The receiving party shall not make any copies of Confidential Information received from the disclosing party except as necessary for its employees with a need to know. Any copies which are made shall be identified as belonging to the disclosing party and marked \"confidential,\" \"proprietary,\" or with a similar legend.\nPERIOD OF CONFIDENTIALITY. Unless a shorter period is stated in the applicable CITR, the disclosing party will not assert any claims against the receiving party for disclosures of Confidential Information made more than five (5) years from the date of the CITR.\nTERMINATION OF OBLIGATION OF CONFIDENTIALITY. The receiving party shall not be liable for the disclosure of any Confidential Information which is:\n(a) in the public domain other than by a breach of this Agreement on the part of the receiving party; or\n(b) rightfully received from a third party without any obligation of confidentiality; or\n(c) rightfully known to the receiving party without any limitation on use or disclosure prior to its receipt from the disclosing party; or\n(d) independently developed by employees of the receiving party; or (e) generally made available to third parties by the disclosing party\nwithout restriction on disclosure.\nTITLE. Title or the right to possess Confidential Information as between the parties shall remain in the disclosing party.\nNO OBLIGATION OF DISCLOSURE. Neither party has any obligation to disclose Confidential Information to the other. Either party may, at any time, cease giving Confidential Information to the other party without any liability or request in writing the return of Confidential Information previously disclosed.\nTERMINATION AND DUTY TO RETURN. Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time without cause upon notice to the other party. However, all obligations of confidentiality shall survive the termination of this Agreement. In the event this Agreement is terminated, and the disclosing party so requests, the receiving party shall promptly return or destroy (and certify destruction of) all Confidential Information which it received from the disclosing party along with all copies which it made.

      "text": "AGREEMENT DATE: JUNE 2, 1999 EXHIBIT 1\nCorporate Non-Disclosure Agreement\nThis Corporate Non-Disclosure Agreement (\"Agreement\") is entered into and made effective as of the date set forth above, by and between Intel Corporation and its majority owned subsidiaries (\"Intel\"), and the Participant identified below (\"Participant\"). Unless the Participant indicates that this Agreement will apply only to the specific division or location, this Agreement will apply to the Participant's entire Company.\nTHE PARTIES AGREE AS FOLLOWS:\n1. Confidential Information Transmittal Form. The confidential, proprietary and made secret information of the disclosing party (\"Confidential Information\") to be disclosed hereunder is that information which (i) is described in the Confidential Information Transmittal Record (\"CITR\") executed from time to time hereafter and (ii) is marked with a \"confidential\", \"proprietary\", or similar legend.\nCITRs are subject to the terms of this Agreement. CITRs will be executed, in writing or in electronic form, by the parties prior to the disclosure of Confidential Information. All Confidential Information received from the disclosing party will be in tangible form. To be considered Confidential Information, non-tangible disclosures must be identified as confidential prior to disclosure and produced in writing, marked as provided above and delivered to the receiving party within thirty (30) days of the original date of disclosure. The CITR will indicate the disclosing party, a description of the Confidential Information disclosed, the names of the representatives of the parties and the dates when the disclosure covered by the CITR commenced.\n2. Obligations of Receiving Party. The receiving party will maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information of the disclosing party with at least the same degree of care that it uses to protect its own confidential and proprietary information, but no less than a reasonable degree of care under the circumstances. The receiving party will not disclose any of the disclosing party's Confidential Information to any employees or to any third parties except to the receiving party's employees, parent company and majority-owned subsidiaries who have a need to know and who agree to abide by nondisclosure terms at least as comprehensive as those set forth herein: provided that the receiving party will be liable for breach by any such entity. The receiving party will not make any copies of the Confidential Information received from the disclosing party except as necessary for its employees, parent company and majority-owned subsidiaries with a need to know. Any copies which are made will be identified as belonging to the disclosing party and marked \"confidential\", \"proprietary\", or with a similar legend.\n3. Period of Non-Assertion. Unless a shorter period is indicated in the applicable CITR, the disclosing party will not insert any claims of breach of this Agreement or misappropriation of trade secrets against the receiving party arising from the receiving party's disclosure of the disclosing party's Confidential Information made more than five (5) years from the date of the CITR under which such information was disclosed. However, unless at least one of the exceptions set for in Section 4 below has occurred, the receiving party will continue to treat such confidential Information as the confidential information of the disclosing party and only disclose any such Confidential Information to third parties under the terms of a non-disclosure agreement.\n4. Termination of Obligation of Confidentiality. The receiving party will not be liable for the disclosure of any Confidential Information which is:\n(a) rightfully in public domain other than by a breach of duty to the disclosing party\n(b) rightfully received from a third party without any obligation of confidentiality\n(c) rightfully known to the receiving party without any limitation on use or disclosure prior to its receipt from the disclosing party\n(d) independently developed by employees of the receiving party; or\n(e) generally made available to third parties by the disclosing party without restriction on disclosure.\n5. Title. Title or the right to possess Confidential Information as between the parties will remain in the disclosing party.\n6. No Obligation of Disclosure: Termination. Neither party has any obligation to disclose Confidential Information to the other. Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time without cause upon written notice to the other party: provided that each party's\nobligations with respect to Confidential Information disclosed during the term of this Agreement will survive any such termination. Either party may, at any time: (a) cease giving Confidential Information to the other party without any liability and/or (b) request in writing the return or destruction of all or part of its Confidential Information previously disclosed, and all copies thereof, and the receiving party will promptly comply with such request, and certify in writing its compliance.\n7. Residuals. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, either party may use Residuals for any purpose, including without limitation use in development manufacture, promotion, sale and maintenance of its products or services: provided that this right to Residuals does not represent a licence under any patents, copyrights or other intellectual property rights of the disclosing party. The term \"Residuals\" means any information retained in the unaided memories of the receiving party's employees who have had access to the disclosing party's Confidential Information pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. An employee's memory is unaided if the employee has not intentionally memorized the Confidential Information for the purpose of retaining and subsequently using or disclosing it.\n8. General.\n(a) This Agreement is neither intended to nor will it be considered as creating a joint venture, partnership or other form of business association between the parties, nor an obligation to buy or sell products using or incorporating the Confidential Information.\n(b) Both parties understand and acknowledge that no license under any patent, copyright, trade secret, or other intellectual property right is granted to or conferred upon, either party in this Agreement or by the disclosure of any Confidential Information by one party to the other party as contemplated hereunder, either expressly, by implication, inducement, estoppel or otherwise, and that any license under such intellectual property rights must be express and in writing.\n(c) The failure of either party to enforce any right resulting from breach of any provision of this Agreement by the other party will not be deemed a waiver of any right relating to a subsequent breach of such provision or of any other right hereunder.\n(d) This Agreement will be governed by laws of the State of Delaware without reference to conflict of laws principles.\n(e) This Agreement, any accompanying CITR and CITRs executed from time to time hereafter which incorporate the terms of this Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the disclosure(s) of Confidential Information described in each CITR, and may not be amended except in a writing signed by a duly authorized representative of the respective parties. Any other agreements between the parties, including non-disclosure agreements, will not be affected by this Agreement.\nINTEL CONTACT: Mohammad Aboobaker M/S: FMS-92 TEL NO: 356-6084\nAGREED:\nINTEL CORPORATION\n2200 Mission College Blvd.\nSanta Clara, CA 95052-8119 PARTICIPANT: DSP Communications\n20300 Stevens Creek Blvd.\nCupertino, CA 95014\n/s/ DAVIDI GILO\n-----------------------------------------\nSignature of Authorized Representative (e.g. President or V.P.)

Samples (\"Samples\"), Wyndham Hotel Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the \"Acquiror\"), and ClubHouse Hotels, Inc., a Kansas corporation (the \"Target Company\").\nRECITALS\nA. Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of July, 21 1997 among the Target Company, the Acquiror, WHC Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation (\"MergerSub\"), Samples and David H. Aull (the \"Merger Agreement\"), the parties have agreed to the merger of MergerSub with and into the Target Company (the \"Merger\") and certain related transactions (the Merger and such related transactions are collectively referred to herein as the \"Merger Transactions\"), all on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement and such other ancillary agreements as are referenced therein.\nB. Samples is a principal stockholder of the Target Company and, as such, will derive substantial benefit from the Merger Transactions.\nC. Each of the Acquiror and the Target Company has been and presently is engaged (itself and through its subsidiaries and the Related Entities) in the business of owning, franchising, licensing and operating hotels (the \"Business\"). Samples is a director and the President and Chief Financial Officer of the Target Company (and is also an officer and/or director of certain of the Target Company's subsidiaries and affiliates and the Related Entities).\nD. The Merger Agreement provides, as a condition to the Closing thereunder, that Samples shall execute and deliver this Agreement.\nE. The agreements of Samples hereunder are an important aspect of the Merger Transactions, and the Acquiror and MergerSub would not consummate the Merger Transactions absent the execution and delivery by Samples of this Agreement.\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual promises contained herein, and of other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties do hereby agree as follows:\n1. Certain Definitions. Terms with initial capital letters used herein that are not defined herein shall have the meanings provided for such terms in the Merger Agreement. As used herein, the term \"Target Company\" shall mean ClubHouse Hotels, Inc. prior to the consummation of the Merger and as the surviving corporation in the Merger.\n2. Restrictive Covenants.\n(a) Samples hereby acknowledges and agrees that (i) the know-how, trade secrets, intellectual property rights, marketing and operating techniques, contacts, customers, suppliers, technology and other aspects of the business of the Target Company and the Related Entities have been, and hereafter will be, of value to the Acquiror, the Target Company and the Related Entities and have provided, and hereafter will provide, the Acquiror, the Target Company and the Related Entities with substantial competitive advantage in the operation of their businesses; (ii) by virtue of his previous relationship with the Target Company and the Related Entities as an officer, director, shareholder and employee, he has detailed and substantial knowledge and possesses confidential information concerning the business, operations, pricing structure, customers, suppliers, personnel and competitive methods of the Target Company and the Related Entities; and (iii) he has substantial financial resources and experience in the business of owning, franchising, licensing and operating hotels and the ability to operate a business or businesses that could compete with the Acquiror, the Target Company, their respective subsidiaries and affiliates and the other Related Entities.\n(b) Samples agrees that, except for such disclosure as may be required by applicable law, he shall not, directly or indirectly, for himself or through or on behalf of any other person or entity, at any time after the date hereof, without the prior written consent of the Acquiror, reveal, divulge, disclose or communicate to any person, firm, association, corporation or other entity, or use, in any manner whatsoever any know-how, trade secrets, intellectual property rights, marketing and operating techniques, business contacts, client or customer lists, suppliers, technology, contracts or other confidential or proprietary information of the Target Company, any Related Entity or any of their respective affiliates (except Innco Hospitality, Inc. and any entity controlled by Innco Hospitality, Inc. and Transamerican Properties, Inc. and T.I.P. Realty Partners, and any entity controlled by either of them and the Broadway Plaza Suites in Kansas City, Missouri); provided, however, that for purposes hereof, information shall not be considered to be confidential or proprietary if (i) it is a matter of common knowledge or public record or (ii) the Undersigned can demonstrate that such information was already known to the recipient thereof other than by reason of any breach of any obligation under this Agreement or any other confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement.\n(c) Samples agrees that, for a period of five (5) years (or such lesser period hereinafter provided for) following the date hereof (the \"Restricted Period\"), he shall not, without the prior express written consent of the Acquiror:\n(i) except with respect to the Permitted Hotels (as defined below), call upon, solicit, divert, take away or attempt to call upon, solicit, divert or take away any existing or potential customers, suppliers or accounts of the Acquiror Companies, the Target Company or the Related Entities or their respective businesses in connection with any business substantially similar to the Business;\n(ii) hire or attempt to hire, for himself or on behalf of any other person, any present or future employee of the Acquiror Companies, the Target Company or any Related Entity; or\n(iii) own, lease, maintain, operate, franchise, license, manage, invest in or provide financing for, or give any advice to any person, firm, partnership, association, venture, corporation or other entity owning an interest in or engaging, directly or indirectly, in the management or operation of, (A) any Hilton Garden, Courtyard by Marriott or Doubletree Club hotel wherever located or (B) any other Upscale Hotel (as defined below) or Extended Stay Hotel (as defined below) located in the United States, Canada, Mexico or the Caribbean within a ten (10)-mile radius of any hotel now or hereafter operated under the \"Wyndham,\" \"ClubHouse,\" or \"Homegate\" brand, except for any such activity conducted for or on behalf of, or in conjunction with, any of the Acquiror Companies or, in the case of clause (B), Permitted Hotels (as defined below); provided, that if a hotel operated under the \"Wyndham,\" \"ClubHouse,\" or \"Homegate\" brand is announced for a location that is within a ten (10)-mile radius of any hotel that prior to the date of such announcement was in operation and is owned, managed or operated by any such entity in which Samples has also prior to such date commenced involvement of a type that would otherwise be restricted by clause (B), then this clause (iii) shall not require Samples to cease such involvement; or\n(iv) enter into any contract or make any commitment to take any action that is restricted by clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) above.\n(d) As used in the foregoing provisions, (i) the term \"Upscale Hotel\" shall mean any hotel or other lodging facility that is a full service hotel or facility of a type that is treated or classified as an \"upscale hotel\" or as part of the \"upscale segment\" of the lodging industry by Smith Travel Research or, if such a classification is not available from Smith Travel Research, by a similar reputable hotel industry service; (ii) the term \"Extended Stay Hotel\" shall mean any hotel or other lodging facility that derives the majority of its business from guests who stay three consecutive nights or longer or that is of a type that is treated or classified as an \"extended stay hotel\" or as part of the \"extended stay segment\" of the lodging industry by Smith Travel Research or, if such a classification is not available from Smith Travel Research, by a similar reputable hotel industry service and (iii) \"Permitted Hotels\" shall mean, collectively, (A) the hotel in Wichita, Kansas operated as of the date hereof as the Wichita Airport Hilton and (B) the hotel in Peoria, Illinois operated as of the date hereof as the Pere Marquette, (C) any upscale all-suites hotel located or to be located adjacent to the Sprint campus in Overland Park, Kansas, (D) the Holiday Inn in Topeka, Kansas, so long as managed under a management contract by Samples or any entity controlled by Samples; (E) if so provided by Section 2(e) below, any three (3) other hotels that, at the time that Samples owns, leases, operates, franchises, licenses, manages, invests in or gives advice in respect of such hotels, have been open and in operation for at least one (1) years, provided that this clause (E) and the similar provision of the Non-Competition and Non-Disclosure Agreement of David H. Aull of even date herewith shall collectively not authorize more than a total of three hotels; (F) the Broadway Plaza Suites in Kansas City, Missouri and (G) any Extended Stay Hotel at a specified site if (x) Samples has offered in writing to Acquiror or its designee to develop for Acquiror or such designee an Extended Stay Hotel at such site as a Homegate brand (or other extended stay brand maintained by Acquiror, Target Company or their respective affiliates) Extended Stay Hotel in accordance with the procedure set forth below and (y) Acquiror or its designee has either advised Samples that it does not wish to have an Extended Stay Hotel developed at such site as a Homegate (or other extended stay brand maintained by Acquiror, Target Company or their respective affiliates) or failed to respond within the time period set forth below. In the case of clause (G) above, Samples' offer shall include a reasonably detailed proposal for the development of the site as an Extended Stay Hotel. Acquiror or its designee shall be given at least thirty (30) days to evaluate such offer and respond to Samples. If Acquiror or its designee fails to respond within such thirty (30) day period or advises Samples that it does not wish to have an Extended Stay Hotel developed at such site as a Homegate (or other extended stay brand maintained by Acquiror, Target Company or their respective affiliates), Samples may develop an Extended Stay Hotel on such site with another party if construction of such Extended Stay Hotel is commenced within 180 days thereafter and is pursued with reasonable diligence thereafter.\n(e) If, by July 1, 1998, Samples has not entered into an agreement with the Acquiror (or any successor to or affiliate of the Acquiror or any such successor) concerning the development, franchise or operation of a hotel, then upon such date the definition of Permitted Hotels in Section 2(d) above shall include clause (E) thereof from and after such date. As used in the preceding sentence and in Section 2(f) below, an \"affiliate\" of any person means any other person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, such first person.\n(f) If, by July 1, 1998 (if the merger of Acquiror into Patriot Hospitality, Inc. provided for in the Patriot-Acquiror Merger Agreement (as defined in the Merger Agreement) (the\"Patriot-Acquiror Merger\") has not occurred by that date) or one (1) year after the closing of the Patriot-Acquiror Merger (if such merger has occurred prior to July 1, 1998), Samples has not entered into an agreement with the Acquiror (or any successor to or affiliate of the Acquiror or any such successor) concerning the development, franchise or operation of a hotel, then upon such date the term of the Restricted Period automatically shall be reduced from five (5) to three (3) years.\n(g) Except as otherwise expressly permitted hereby, the covenants in this Section 2 are intended to restrict Samples from competing in any manner with the Acquiror Companies, the Target Company and the Related Entities or the Business in the activities that have heretofore been carried on by the Acquiror Companies, the Target Company and the Related Entities. The obligations set forth in this Section above shall apply to actions by Samples, whether taken directly or indirectly, through any form of ownership, and whether as principal, officer, director, agent, employee, employer, consultant, stockholder or holder of any equity security (beneficially or as trustee of any trust), lender, partner, joint venturer or in any other individual or representative capacity whatsoever. However, none of the foregoing shall prevent Samples from (i) being the holder of up to 5% in the aggregate of any class of securities of any corporation engaged in the activities described above, provided that such securities are listed on a national securities exchange or reported on NASDAQ or (ii) being the holder of non-convertible debt securities of any entity.\n3. Enforcement of Covenants. Samples acknowledges that a violation or attempted violation of any of the covenants and agreements in Section 2 above will cause such damage to the Acquiror Companies, the Target Company and the Related Entities as will be irreparable, the exact amount of which would be difficult to ascertain and for which there will be no adequate remedy at law, and accordingly, Samples agrees that each of the Acquiror Companies and the Target Company and any Related Entity shall be entitled as a matter of right to an injunction issued by any court of competent jurisdiction, restraining such violation or attempted violation of such covenants and agreements by Samples, or the employees, partners or agents of Samples, as well as recover from Samples any and all costs and expenses sustained or incurred by the Acquiror Companies and the Target Company and the Related Entities in obtaining such an injunction, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees. Samples agrees that no bond or other security shall be required in connection with such injunction. Samples further agrees that the Restricted Period shall be tolled during any period of violation thereof by Samples. Any exercise by any one or more of the Acquiror Companies and the Target Company and the Related Entities of their respective rights pursuant to this Section 3 shall be cumulative and in addition to any other remedies to each of them may be entitled.\n4. Intellectual Property. Samples recognizes and agrees that, on and after the date hereof, he will not have the right to use for his own account any of the service marks, trademarks, trade names, licenses, labels, trade secrets or customers' lists owned by or licensed to the Acquiror Companies, the Target Company or any of the Related Entities.\n5. Consideration. As consideration for Samples' agreements provided herein, the Acquiror agrees to pay to Samples the total sum of $500,000, which amount shall be payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds on the date hereof. Samples also acknowledges and agrees that, in addition thereto, he has received substantial consideration and benefit, direct and indirect, pursuant to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\n6. Validity. Samples acknowledges and agrees that each of the covenants contained herein is a reasonable limitation as to time, geographical area and scope of activity to be restrained and does not impose a greater restraint than is necessary to protect the goodwill or other interests of the Acquiror Companies and the Target Company and the Related Entities. To the extent permitted by applicable law, if it should ever be held that any provision contained herein does not contain reasonable limitations as to time, geographical area or scope of activity to be restrained, then the court so holding shall at the request of any of the Acquiror Companies or the Target Company or any Related Entity reform such provisions to the extent necessary to cause them to contain reasonable limitations as to time, geographical area and scope of activity to be restrained and to give the maximum permissible effect to the intentions of the parties as set forth herein; and the court shall enforce such provisions as so reformed. If, notwithstanding the foregoing, any provision hereof is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under present or future laws effective during the term hereof, such provision shall be fully severable; this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof; and the remaining provisions hereof shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or enforceable provision or by its severance here from. Furthermore, in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision there shall be added automatically by the Acquiror and the Target Company as a part hereof a provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible and be legal, valid and enforceable, and the parties hereby agree to such provision.\n7. Waiver of Breach. The waiver by any party to this Agreement of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach by any party.\n8. Tax Reporting. The parties hereby expressly agree that the consideration given and received pursuant to this Agreement shall, for income tax purposes, be reported as amounts paid for a covenant not to compete. The parties acknowledge that Samples shall be solely responsible for the payment of any federal, state or local taxes arising from his receipt of the consideration under this Agreement.\n9. Notice. Any notice, request, instruction, document or other communication to be given hereunder by any party hereto to any other party hereto shall be in writing and validly given if (i) delivered personally, (ii) sent by telecopy, (iii) delivered by overnight express, or (iv) sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, as follows:\nIf to Acquiror or the Target Company:\nWyndham Hotel Corporation/ClubHouse Hotels, Inc.\n2001 Bryan Street\nSuite 2300\nDallas, TX 75201\nAttention: Legal Department\nFacsimile No. (214) 863-1262\nIf to Samples:\nMr. Roland W.

No modification or amendment of any of the terms, conditions or provisions in this Agreement may be made otherwise than by written agreement signed by the parties hereto, except as provided in Section 6 hereof.\n11. Successors and Assigns. The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns; provided, however, that the obligations herein of Samples may not be delegated or assigned, and any purported delegation or assignment by Samples in violation of this Section 11 shall be null and void. Samples hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Acquiror Companies and Related Entities, and any other entity now or hereafter owning or operating any hotel operated under the \"Wyndham,\" \"ClubHouse\" or \"Homegate\" brand, are intended beneficiaries of the provisions hereof, notwithstanding the fact that such entities may not be parties hereto, and shall be entitled to enforce the provisions hereof as if they were parties hereto.\n12. Headings. The headings of the sections of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to constitute part of this Agreement or to affect the construction hereof.\n13. Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED, ENFORCED, AND GOVERNED BY THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE (WITHOUT REGARD TO\nITS CHOICE OF LAW PRINCIPLES).\n14. Counterparts.

(\"OACIS\") and Science Applications International Corporation (\"SAIC\") as of November 4th, 1998 (the \"EFFECTIVE DATE\").\n1. As used herein, \"CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\" shall mean any and all technical and non-technical information provided by either party to the other, including but not limited to (a) patent and patent applications, (b) trade secret, and (c) proprietary information, ideas, techniques, sketches, drawings, works of authorship, models, inventions, know-how, processes, apparatuses, equipment, algorithms, software programs, software source documents, and formulae related to the current, future, and proposed products and services of each of the parties, and including, without limitation, their respective information concerning research, experimental work, development, design details and specifications, engineering, financial information, procurement requirements, purchasing, manufacturing, customer lists, investors, employees, business and contractual relationships, business forecasts, sales and merchandising, marketing plans and information the disclosing party provides regarding third parties.\n2. Each party agrees that at all times until termination or expiration of this Agreement it will hold in strict confidence and not disclose to any third party Confidential Information of the other, except as approved in writing by the other party to this Agreement, and will use the Confidential Information for no purpose other than evaluating or pursuing a business relationship with the other party to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the above, the party to whom Confidential Information was disclosed (the \"RECIPIENT\") shall not be in violation of this Section 3 with regard to a disclosure that was in response to a valid order by a court or other governmental body, provided that the Recipient provides the other party with prior written notice of such disclosure in order to permit the other party to seek confidential treatment of such information. Each party shall only permit access to Confidential Information of the other party to those of its employees or authorized representatives having a need to know and who have signed confidentiality agreements or are otherwise bound by confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those contained herein.\n3. Each party shall immediately notify the other upon discovery of any loss or unauthorized disclosure of the Confidential Information of the other party.\n4. Each party's obligations under this Agreement with respect to any portion of the other party's Confidential Information shall terminate when the Recipient can document that: (a) it was in the public domain at the time it was communicated to the Recipient by the other party; (b) it entered the public domain subsequent to the time it was communicated to the Recipient by the other party through no fault of the Recipient; (c) it was in the Recipient's possession free of any obligation of confidence at the time it was communicated to the Recipient by the other party; (d) it was rightfully communicated to the Recipient free of any obligation of confidence subsequent to the time it was communicated to the Recipient by the other party or (e) it was communicated by the other party to an unaffiliated third party free of any obligation of confidence.\n5. Upon termination or expiration of the Agreement, or upon written request of the other party, each party shall promptly destroy or return to the other all documents and other tangible materials representing the other's Confidential Information and all copies thereof. The Recipient agrees to destroy all documents, memoranda, notes and other writings whatsoever prepared by the Recipient or its employees or representatives based on the information contained in the Confidential Information (except for references or summaries appearing in minutes or corporate records).\n6. In addition, each party agrees that it will not (and direct its employees and representatives not to) disclose (i) to any person either the fact that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning one or more possible transactions between the parties or (ii) any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any such possible transactions, including the status thereof.\n7. Although the disclosing party has endeavored to include in the Confidential Information, information known to it which it believes to be relevant for the purpose of the Recipient's investigation of a potential transaction, the Recipient acknowledges and agrees that neither the disclosing party nor any of its employees or representatives have made or make any representations or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of all or any portion of the Confidential Information. The Recipient agrees that neither the disclosing party nor any of its employees or representatives shall have any liability to the Recipient or any of the Recipient's employees or representatives resulting from the use of, or conclusions arising from, the Confidential Information.\n8. The parties recognize and agree that nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any property rights, by license or otherwise, to any Confidential Information of the other party disclosed pursuant to this Agreement, or to any invention or any patent, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property right that has issued or that may issue, based on such Confidential Information. Neither party shall make, have made, use or sell for any purpose any product or other item using, incorporating or derived from any Confidential Information to the other party.\n9. Confidential Information shall not be reproduced in any form except as required to accomplish the intent of this Agreement. Any reproduction of any Confidential Information of the other party by either party shall remain the property of the disclosing party and shall contain any and all confidential or proprietary notices or legends which appear on the original, unless otherwise authorized in writing by the other party.\n10. Nothing contained herein shall imply any obligations of either party to proceed with a transaction between the parties, and each party reserves the right to terminate the discussions contemplated hereunder, with or without cause, without any liability for such termination.\n11. This Agreement shall terminate three (3) years after the Effective Date and shall be binding upon the Recipient's heirs, successors and assigns.\n12. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of California without reference to conflict of laws principles. This Agreement may not be amended except by a writing signed by both parties hereto.\n13. Each party acknowledges that its breach of the Agreement will cause irreparable damage and hereby agrees that the other party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief under this Agreement, as well as such further relief as may be granted by a court of competent jurisdiction. Additionally, in the event of a breach by the Recipient, the disclosing party shall be entitled to recover the costs of enforcing this Agreement including, without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees.\n14. If any provision of this Agreement is found by a proper authority to be unenforceable or invalid such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render this Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole and in such event, such provision shall be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such unenforceable or invalid provision within the limits of applicable law or applicable court decisions.\n15. Neither party shall communicate any information to the other in violation of the proprietary rights of any third party.\n16. Neither party will assign or transfer any rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party.\n17. Neither party shall export, directly or indirectly, any technical data acquired from the other pursuant to this Agreement or any product utilizing any\nsuch data to any country for which the U.S. Government or any agency thereof at the time of export requires an export license or other governmental approval without first obtaining such license or approval.\n18. All notices or reports permitted or required under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be delivered by personal delivery, electronic mail, facsimile transmission or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, and shall be deemed given upon personal delivery, five (5) days after deposit in the mail, or upon acknowledgment of receipt of electronic transmission. Notices shall be sent to the addresses set forth at the end of this Agreement or such other address as either party may specify in writing.\n19. Each of the parties agrees that the software programs of the other party contain valuable confidential information and each party agrees it will not modify, reverse engineer, decompile, create other works from, or disassemble any software programs contained in the Confidential Information of the other party without the prior written consent of the other party.\n20. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, and such counterparts together shall constitute only one instrument.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement to be executed as of the Effective Date.\nOACIS HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS CORP.

      "text": "NON-DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS\nPursuant to the Agreement to which this Exhibit B is annexed, Company may be disclosing to Independent Contractor certain confidential business plans, development plans, reports, financial information, design documents, specifications, programmer notes, software (its own and/or third party), and/or other information, whether or not so identified (together with any notes, analyses, compilations, studies, or other documents that are based upon, contain, or otherwise reflect such information, the \"Confidential Information,\" which shall include this Agreement). The parties agree as follows with respect to treatment of the Confidential Information:\n1. Independent Contractor shall use the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of performing the Services specified in the applicable SOW and not for any other purpose. Except to the extent permitted by Section 3 below, Independent Contractor will not disclose the Confidential Information, in whole or in part, to any other party. In fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement, Independent Contractor shall use at least the same standard of care it uses to protect its own information of similar kind, but not less than a reasonable standard of care.\n2. The term \"Confidential Information\" shall be deemed not to include information which (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than (a) as a result of a disclosure by Independent Contractor or any other person who directly or indirectly receives such information from the Independent Contractor or (b) in violation of a confidentiality obligation to the Company known to Independent Contractor or (ii) is or becomes available to Independent Contractor on a non-confidential basis from a source which is entitled to disclose it to Independent Contractor or (iii) is independently developed by Independent Contractor without benefit of the Confidential Information.\n3. In the event that Independent Contractor is required by law or by interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, Civil Investigative Demand, or similar process to disclose any information supplied to Independent Contractor pursuant to the Agreement, including without limitation the Confidential Information or any other information the disclosure of which is restricted by the terms of this Exhibit B, Independent Contractor will provide the Company with prompt prior written notice of such request or requirement so that the Company may seek an appropriate protective order. If, in the absence of a protective order, Independent Contractor is nonetheless, in the written opinion of its counsel (which shall be forwarded to the Company upon request), compelled to disclose Confidential Information or any other information the disclosure of which is restricted by the terms of this Exhibit B to any tribunal or else stand liable for contempt or suffer other material censure or penalty, Independent Contractor may disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information or other information which it is advised in writing by its counsel (which shall be forwarded to the Company upon request) is so legally compelled and Independent Contractor will exercise its best efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Confidential Information.\n4. All Confidential Information disclosed by the Company to Independent Contractor shall be and shall remain the Company's property. Upon termination of the Agreement, Independent Contractor shall redeliver all tangible Confidential Information furnished by the Company. Except to the extent Independent Contractor is advised in writing by counsel that such action is prohibited by law, Independent Contractor will also destroy all written material, memoranda, notes, and other writings or recordings whatsoever prepared by it based upon, containing, or otherwise reflecting any Confidential Information. Any Confidential Information that is not returned or destroyed, including without limitation any oral Confidential Information, shall remain subject to the confidentiality obligations set forth in this Exhibit B.\n5. Independent Contractor acknowledges and agrees that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Exhibit B by Independent Contractor and that the Company shall be entitled to specific performance, including without limitation injunctive relief, as a remedy for any such breach. Such remedy shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedy for breach of this Exhibit B but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity. Independent Contractor agrees to reimburse the Company for costs and expenses (including without limitation attorneys' fees) incurred by the Company in connection with the enforcement of this Exhibit B.\n6. If any provision of this Exhibit B is not enforceable in whole or in part, the remaining provisions of this Exhibit B shall not be affected thereby. No failure or delay in exercising any right, power, or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege hereunder.\n",

No information will be regarded as CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION if the Party to which it is disclosed can show by competent proof that such information\n(a) was at the time of disclosure, or subsequently became, through no fault of the receiving Party, known to the general public through publication or otherwise; or\n(b) was, subsequent to disclosure to a Party, lawfully and independently received by that Party from a third party who had the right to disclose it without restriction.\nSpecific aspects or details of CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION shall not be deemed to be within the public domain or in the possession of a Party merely because the CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION is embraced by general disclosures in the public domain or in the possession of a Party. In addition, any combination of CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION shall not be considered in the public domain or in the possession of a Party merely because individual elements thereof are in the public domain or in the possession of that Party unless the combination and its principles are in the public domain or in the possession of that Party.\n2. Any Party, at its discretion, may disclose to another Party any CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION that the disclosing Party, in its reasonable judgment, believes is sufficient to enable the receiving Party to arrive at conceptions, ideas, innovations, discoveries, inventions, compositions, biological material, biological methods, whether or not patentable or susceptible to any other form of legal protection, during performance Under the IRA. Any Party may also cause such disclosures to be made to the other Party on behalf of the disclosing Party by third parties who are Under obligations of confidentiality to the disclosing Party; such disclosures from third parties shall be deemed to be disclosures by the disclosing Party.\n3. In consideration of each and every disclosure of CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, the Parties agree to:\n(a) treat as confidential and to preserve the confidentiality of all CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION;\n(b) use any and all CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION solely in connection with the performance of the IRA and for no other purpose; (c) make no disclosures of any CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION to any party other than officers and employees of a Party to this IRA;\n(d) limit access to CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION to those officers and employees having a reasonable need for such INFORMATION and being boUnd by a written obligation to maintain the confidentiality of such INFORMATION; and\n(e) maintain in confidence any information regarding the nature or scope of any transaction between the Parties, except to the extent such information must be disclosed pursuant to law, and then only after notifying the other Party of such requirement.\nAny obligation imposed by this paragraph 3 may be waived in writing by a Party as to particular CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION and to a particular use or disclosure. Any such waiver will have a one-time effect and will not apply to any subsequent situation regardless of its similarity.\n4. All CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION will remain the property of the disclosing Party and, upon request of the disclosing Party, the receiving Party shall promptly return to the disclosing Party all CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, or any part or reproduction thereof.\n5. The obligations of each and every Party, and each employee and officer of each Party Under this Agreement will expire five (5) years from the termination of the JRA.\n6.

      "text": "AMENDED AND RESTATED\nMUTUAL CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nThis Amended and Restated Mutual Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement (\"Agreement\") is entered into as of March 1, 1998 between TWENTIETH CENTRUTY FOX HOME ENTERTAINMENT, INC. (\"Company\") (collectively, \"Parties\"). This Agreement amends and restates in its entirety the Mutual Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement previously entered into by the Parties. The Parties will provide each other with Confidential Information as defined below in connection with one or more possible or actual transactions between the Parties (each a \"Transaction\"). As a condition of one of the Parties or its agents or its representatives furnishing Confidential Information (\"Furnishing Party\") to the other of the Parties or its agents or its representatives receiving Confidential Information (\"Receiving Party\"), the Receiving Party shall treat the Confidential Information confidentially as set forth below.\n1. \"Confidential Information\" shall mean all non-public proprietary information provided by the Furnishing Party to the Receiving Party, whether or not marked or otherwise specifically designated as confidential. The term \"Confidential Information\" does not include information which (i) becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by the Receiving Party, (ii) was available to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis prior the Furnishing Party's disclosure to the Receiving Party, or (iii) becomes available to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Furnishing Party, provided that such source is, to the best of the Receiving Party's knowledge, not bound by a confidentiality agreement with the Furnishing Party or otherwise prohibited from transmitting the information to the Furnishing Party by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation.\n2. It is understood that the Receiving Party may disclose any of the Confidential Information to the Receiving Party's (and its subsidiaries' and affiliates') directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives (including attorneys and financial advisors), and prospective bank or institutional lenders, (collectively, \"Representatives\") who require such material in connection with a possible or actual Transaction (provided that such Representatives shall be informed by the Receiving Party of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information and shall agree to act in accordance with the terms hereof). The Receiving Party agrees that the Confidential Information of the Furnishing Party will be kept confidential by the Receiving Party and its Representatives and, except with the specific prior written consent of the Furnishing Party, or as expressly otherwise permitted by the terms hereof, will not be disclosed by the Receiving Party or its Representatives. The Parties further agree that the Receiving Party and its Representatives will not use any of the Confidential Information for any reason or purpose other than in connection with a possible or actual Transaction.\n3. Company acknowledges and agrees that certain Confidential Information is extremely competitively sensitive for Fox (\"Highly Confidential Information\") and shall therefore be subject to restrictions on disclosure additional to those applicable to other Confidential Information. Highly Confidential Information shall include the identity of Fox's actual and potential customers and vendors; Fox's release schedules and sales trends; the prices and pricing policies of Fox, its vendors and customers; all customer shipment, point-of-sale and returns information; Fox's strategic planning information regarding system implementation (including geographic implementation) and process improvement; all distribution software used by and software development performed for Fox; Fox's replenishment schedules and processes, inventory management schedules and processes; and any other competitively sensitive Confidential Information designated by Fox from time to time as \"Highly Confidential Information\". Company shall limit disclosure of Highly Confidential Information to Company employees. Company shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any such employee. Company shall not disclose Highly Confidential Information to any of its consultants, or other vendors, or agents.\n4. In the event that the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives are requested or required by applicable Federal or State law of the United States to disclose any of the Confidential Information, it is agreed that the Receiving Party or its Representative, as the case may be, will provide the Furnishing Party with prompt notice of such request(s) so that it may seek an appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance by the Receiving Party or its Representative with the provisions of the Agreement. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or that the Furnishing Party grants a waiver hereunder, the Receiving Party or such Representative of the Receiving Party may furnish that portion (and only that portion) of the Confidential Information which it is legally compelled to disclose and will exercise its best efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded any Confidential Information so furnished.\n5. Without the prior written consent of Company, (i) neither Fox nor those of its Representatives who are aware of the Confidential Information of Company will initiate or cause to be initiated any communications with any employee of Company concerning the Confidential Information, and (ii) none of Fox's directors, officers or employees who are aware of the Confidential Information will, for the two-year period from the date of the Agreement, solicit or cause to be solicited for employment any employee of Company who is aware of the Confidential Information of Company.\n6. Without the prior written consent of Fox, (i) neither Company nor those of its Representatives who are aware of the Confidential Information of Fox will initiate or cause to be initiated any communications with any employee of Fox concerning the Confidential Information, and (ii) none of Company's directors, officers or employees who are aware of the Confidential Information will, for the two-year period from the date of the Agreement, solicit or cause to be solicited for employment any employee of Fox who is aware of the Confidential Information of Fox.\n7. Upon providing the Receiving Party with a specific list of the Confidential Information to be returned to the Furnishing Party, the Receiving Party will promptly deliver to the Furnishing Party or its Representatives, the Confidential Information listed, together with all copies thereof, in the possession of the Receiving Party or its Representatives, which was actually furnished by the Furnishing Party to the Receiving Party.\n8. Although the Receiving Party understands that the Furnishing Party has endeavored to include in the Confidential Information information known to it which it believes to be relevant to a possible or actual Transaction, the Receiving Party further understands that neither the Furnishing Party nor its Representatives make any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information. The Receiving Party agrees that neither the Furnishing Party nor its Representatives shall have any liability to Receiving Party or its Representatives resulting from the use of the Confidential Information by the Receiving Party or its Representatives.\n9. The provisions set forth in this Agreement may be modified or waived only by a separate writing signed by the Parties expressly so modifying or waiving such provisions.\n10. The Receiving Party hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Furnishing Party from any damage, loss, cost or liability (including legal fees and the cost of enforcing this indemnity) arising out of, or resulting from, any unauthorized use or disclosure by the Receiving Party or its Representatives of the Confidential Information. The Receiving Party also acknowledges that money damages would be both incalculable and an insufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by it or its Representatives and that any such breach would cause the Furnishing Party irreparable harm. Accordingly, the Receiving Party also\nagrees that in the event of any breach of this Agreement, the Furnishing Party, in addition to any other remedies at law or in equity it may have, shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance.\n11. It is understood and agreed that no failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder.\n12. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity of enforceability of any other provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that this Agreement and the rights and benefits thereof shall be assigned by the party to any purchaser of a controlling share of equity in that party.\n13. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California.\n14. The Parties hereby represent and warrant that the undersigned officer is authorized to execute this Agreement on its behalf.\nBy signing in the spaces provided below, Fox and Company have agreed to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.\nTWENTIETH CENTURY FOX HOME ENTERTAINMENT, INC.\nBy: /s/ Laura Cook\nIts: Senior Vice President\nLegal and Business Affairs\nTwentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment, Inc.\nARTISAN HOME ENTERTAINMENT, INC.\nBy: /s/ Mark Curcio\nIts: CEO\n",

      "text": "MUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nThis Agreement made this 22 of March 2005, by and between Symmetrex Inc. (\"Symmetrex\") with an address of 850 Trafalgar Court, Suite 110, Maitland FL, 32751 and MORGAN BEAUMONT INC. with an address at 6015 31st Street East, Bradenton, FL 34203 (\"Other Party\").\nWHEREAS, SYMMETREX and Other Party (jointly the \"parties\") wish to disclose to each other certain information solely for the purpose of evaluating a proposed business arrangement between the parties (the \"Evaluation\"); and\nWHEREAS, in consideration of and as an inducement for and condition of such disclosure, each party hereby requires the other party to agree to the terms and conditions of this agreement.\nNOW, THEREFORE, for adequate consideration acknowledged to be received by each party, each party, intending to be legally bound, hereby agrees as follows:\n1. For all purposes of this agreement, the following definitions shall apply:\nA. \"Confidential Information\" of a party shall mean any trade secrets, know-how, inventions, products, designs, methods, techniques, systems, processes, software programs, works of authorship, business plans, customer lists, projects, plans, pricing, proposals and any other information which a party discloses to the Recipient Party that: (i) if disclosed in writing is clearly marked as confidential or carries a similar legend; or (ii) if disclosed verbally or in tangible form is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure, then summarized in a writing so marked by the Disclosing Party and delivered to the Recipient Party with fifteen (15) days. Confidential Information shall also include the terms of this agreement, the fact that the information is being made available to the parties hereunder and the fact that the parties are contemplating a possible business arrangement.\nB. \"Disclosing Party\" shall mean, with respect to any information disclosed by one party to the other, the party which, directly or through one of its agents, discloses such information.\nC. \"Recipient Party\" shall mean, with respect to any information disclosed by one party to the other, the party which receives such information.\n2. Each Recipient Party with respect to Confidential Information received by it hereunder shall:\nA. Hold such Confidential Information in strict confidence and protect it in accordance with a standard of care which shall be no less than the care it uses to protect its own information of like importance and in no event less than reasonable care.\nB. Not use such Confidential Information for any purpose except as is necessary for the Evaluation referenced above or as otherwise authorized in writing by the Disclosing Party of such information in advance.\nC. Not disclose Confidential Information to any person other than to one of the Recipient Party's directors, officers, employees, representatives, consultants or agents (collectively called \"Representatives\") who need to know such information for the purposes of the Evaluation, provided that each Representative shall be informed, directed and obligated by the Recipient Party to treat such information in accordance with the obligations of this agreement and the Recipient Party shall be liable for breach of any such obligation by any of its Representatives.\nD. Not copy or otherwise duplicate such Confidential Information, or knowingly allow anyone else to copy or otherwise duplicate any such Confidential Information without the Disclosing Party's prior written approval.\n3. Each Recipient Party shall notify the Disclosing Party in the event that any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party is required to be disclosed by the Recipient Party by judicial, administrative or other govern mental order. Such notification shall be made reasonably promptly so that the Disclosing Party, at its expense, may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy. Provided such notification is given, the Recipient Party is hereby authorized to comply with such judicial, administrative or governmental order. The Recipient Party shall provide the Disclosing Party reasonable cooperation (at the expense of the Disclosing Party) in connection with any protective order or other remedy sought by the Disclosing Party in connection with such order.\n4. The obligations imposed on a Recipient Party with respect to Confidential Information shall not apply to Confidential Information disclosed to it hereunder which (a) the Recipient Party can demonstrate is, at the time of disclosure, already known to the Recipient Party, (b) is or becomes generally known to the public or is otherwise deemed to be in the public domain through no wrongful act of the Recipient Party, (c) is received from a third party who has the legal right to so furnish such Confidential Information, or (d) the Recipient Party can demonstrate is independently developed by or for the Recipient Party without use of Confidential Information.\n5. Upon the written request of the Disclosing Party with respect to any Confidential Information disclosed by it hereunder, the Recipient Party shall return to the Disclosing Party any or all of such information and all copies, contracts or other reproductions in whole or in part thereof or, with the written permission of such Disclosing Party, effect the destruction of all of same and certify such destruction in writing to the Disclosing Party.\n6. Each party acknowledges that the other party has no legal obligation pursuant to this agreement to disclose information to it hereunder but is doing so as an accommodation to the Recipient Party in reliance upon the terms of this agreement and that all information received by the Recipient Party hereunder cannot be relied upon as a representation or warranty of the Disclosing Party and, accordingly, no Disclosing Party shall be liable for any reliance upon any information disclosed by it hereunder, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Disclosing Party.\n7. Nothing contained in this agreement shall be construed as granting to either party any right, title or interest in any information disclosed hereunder to it, except for the limited right to use and disclosure as expressly permitted hereunder.\n8. Each Recipient Party shall on any copies it may make of any information received hereunder maintain any and all copyright, patent or trademark notices which may appear on such information when so received.\n9. Each party represents that the disclosure by it of information hereunder does not violate the rights of any other entity.\n10. If either Party breaches its promises made in this Agreement, the non-breaching Party will have available to it all remedies available under law.\n11. This agreement shall become effective on the date it is fully executed and delivered by both parties and both this agreement and the duties of the parties hereunder shall continue for a period of two years after the last disclosure of information made hereunder.\n12. This agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each party and its successors. No representations have been made to induce either party to enter this agreement other than those expressly stated herein. This agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or expressions of intent or understanding and is the entire agreement between the parties with respect to its subject matter. Neither party shall be charged with any waiver of any provision of this agreement unless such waiver is evidenced by a writing signed by an authorized officer of such party and any such waiver shall be limited to the terms of such writing. This agreement shall not be changed or terminated, except by a writing signed by an authorized officer of Symmetrex and an authorized officer of Other Party. This agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Florida, without regard to the conflicts of law principles of that state.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this agreement as of the date stated above.\nMORGAN BEAUMONT, INC.

      "text": "NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nAnnex D\nMICROSOFT CORPORATION NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\n(STANDARD RECIPROCAL)\nThis Non-Disclosure Agreement (the \"Agreement\") is made and entered into as of the later of the two signature dates below by and between MICROSOFT CORPORATION, a Washington corporation (\"Microsoft\"), and STARBAND COMMUNICATIONS INC./DELAWARE corporation (\"Company\").\nIN CONSIDERATION OF THE MUTUAL PROMISES AND COVENANTS CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT AND THE MUTUAL DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, THE PARTIES HERETO AGREE AS FOLLOWS:\n1. Definition of Confidential Information and Exclusions.\n(a) \"Confidential Information\" means nonpublic information that a party to this Agreement (\"Disclosing Party\") designates as being confidential to the party that receives such information (\"Receiving Party\") or which, under the circumstances surrounding disclosure ought to be treated as confidential by the Receiving Party. \"Confidential Information\" includes, without limitation, information in tangible or intangible form relating to and/or including released or unreleased Disclosing Party software or hardware products, the marketing or promotion of any Disclosing Party product, Disclosing Party's business policies or practices, and information received from others that Disclosing Party is obligated to treat as confidential. Except as otherwise indicated in this Agreement, the term \"Disclosing Party\" also includes all Affiliates of the Disclosing Party and, except as otherwise indicated, the term \"Receiving Party\" also includes all Affiliates of the Receiving Party. An \"Affiliate\" means any person, partnership, joint venture, corporation or other form of enterprise, domestic or foreign, including but not limited to subsidiaries, that directly or indirectly, control, are controlled by, or are under common control with a party.\n(b) Confidential Information shall not include any information, however designated, that: (i) is or subsequently becomes publicly available without Receiving Party's breach of any obligation owed Disclosing Party; (ii) became known to Receiving Party prior to Disclosing Party's disclosure of such information to Receiving Party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; (iii) became known to Receiving Party from a source other than Disclosing Party other than by the breach of an obligation of confidentiality owed to Disclosing Party; (iv) is independently developed by Receiving Party; or (v) constitutes Feedback (as defined in Section 5 of this Agreement).\n2. Obligations Regarding Confidential Information\n(a) Receiving Party shall:\n(i) Refrain from disclosing any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to third parties for two (2) years following the date that Disclosing Party first discloses such Confidential Information to Receiving Party, except as expressly provided in Sections 2(b) and 2(c) of this Agreement;\n(ii) Take reasonable security precautions, at least as great as the precautions it takes to protect its own confidential information, but no less than reasonable care, to keep confidential the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party;\n(iii) Refrain from disclosing, reproducing, summarizing and/or distributing Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party except in pursuance of Receiving Party's business relationship with Disclosing Party, and only as otherwise provided hereunder; and\n(iv) Refrain from reverse engineering, decompiling or disassembling any software code and/or pre-release hardware devices disclosed by Disclosing Party to Receiving Party under the terms of this Agreement, except as expressly permitted by applicable law.\n(b) Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of Disclosing Party in accordance with a judicial or other governmental order, provided that Receiving Party either (i) gives the undersigned Disclosing Party reasonable notice prior to such disclosure to allow Disclosing Party a reasonable opportunity to seek a protective order or equivalent, or (ii) obtains written assurance from the applicable judicial or governmental entity that it will afford the Confidential Information the highest level of protection afforded under applicable law or regulation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party shall not disclose any computer source code that contains Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party in accordance with a judicial or other governmental order unless it complies with the requirement set forth in sub-section (i) of this Section 2(b).\n(c) The undersigned Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information only to Receiving Party's employees and consultants on a need-to-know basis. The undersigned Receiving Party will have executed or shall execute appropriate written agreements with third parties sufficient to enable Receiving Party to enforce all the provisions of this Agreement.\n(d) Receiving Party shall notify the undersigned Disclosing Party immediately upon discovery of any unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information or any other breach of this Agreement by Receiving Party and its employees and consultants, and will cooperate with Disclosing Party in every reasonable way to help Disclosing Party regain possession of the Confidential Information and prevent its further unauthorized use or disclosure.\n(e) Receiving Party shall, at Disclosing Party's request, return all originals, copies, reproductions and summaries of Confidential Information and all other tangible materials and devices provided to the Receiving Party as Confidential Information, or at Disclosing Party's option, certify destruction of the same.\n3. Remedies\nThe parties acknowledge that monetary damages may not be a sufficient remedy for unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information and that Disclosing Party shall be entitled, without waiving any other rights or remedies, to such injunctive or equitable relief as may be deemed proper by a court of competent jurisdiction.\n4. Miscellaneous\n(a) All Confidential Information is and shall remain the property of Disclosing Party. By disclosing Confidential information to Receiving Party, Disclosing Party does not grant any express or implied right to Receiving Party to or under any patents, copyrights, trademarks, or trade secret information except as otherwise provided herein. Disclosing Party reserves without prejudice the ability to protect its rights under any such patents, copyrights, trademarks, or trade secrets except as otherwise provided herein.\n(b) In the event that the Disclosing Party provides any computer software and/or hardware to the Receiving Party as Confidential Information under the terms of this Agreement, such computer software and/or hardware may only be used by the Receiving Party for evaluation and providing Feedback (as defined in Section 5 of this Agreement) to the Disclosing Party. Unless otherwise agreed by the Disclosing Party and the Receiving Party, all such computer software and/or hardware is provided \"AS IS\" without warranty of any kind, and Receiving Party agrees that neither Disclosing Party nor its suppliers shall be liable for any damages whatsoever arising from or relating to Receiving Party's use or inability to use such software and/or hardware.\n(c) The parties agree to comply with all applicable international and national laws that apply to (i) any Confidential Information, or (ii) any product (or any part thereof), process or service that is the direct product of the Confidential Information, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, as well as end-user, end-use and destination restrictions issued by U.S. and other governments. For additional information on exporting Microsoft products, see http://www.microsoft.com/exporting/.\n(d) The terms of confidentiality under this Agreement shall not be construed to limit either the Disclosing Party or the Receiving Party's right to independently develop or acquire products without use of the other party's Confidential Information. Further, the Receiving Party shall be free to use for any purpose the residuals resulting from access to or work with the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, provided that the Receiving Party shall not disclose the Confidential Information except as expressly permitted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. The term \"residuals\" means information in intangible form, which is retained in memory by persons who have had access to the Confidential Information, including ideas, concepts, know-how or techniques contained therein. The Receiving Party shall not have any obligation to limit or restrict the assignment of such persons or to pay royalties for any work resulting from the use of residuals. However, this sub-paragraph shall not be deemed to grant to the Receiving Party a license under the Disclosing Party's copyrights or patents.\n(e) This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. It shall not be modified except by a written agreement dated subsequent to the date of this Agreement and signed by both parties. None of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been waived by any act or acquiescence on the part of Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party, their agents, or employees, but only by an instrument in writing signed by an authorized employee of Disclosing Party and the Receiving Party. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any other provision(s) or of the same provision on another occasion.\n(f) If either Disclosing Party or the Receiving Party employs attorneys to enforce any rights arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees and costs. This Agreement shall be construed and controlled by the laws of the State of Washington, and the parties further consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal courts sitting in King County, Washington, unless no federal subject matter jurisdiction exists, in which case the parties consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the Superior of King County, Washington. Company waives all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens. Process may be served on either party in the manner authorized by applicable law or court rule.\n(g) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each party's respective successors and lawful assigns; provided, however, that neither party may assign this Agreement (whether by operation of law, sale of securities or assets, merger or otherwise), in whole or in part, without the prior written approval of the other party. Any attempted assignment in violation of this Section shall be void.\n(h) If any provision of this Agreement shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.\n(i) Either party may terminate this Agreement with or without cause upon ninety (90) days prior written notice to the other party. All sections of this Agreement relating to the rights and obligations of the parties concerning Confidential Information disclosed during the term of the Agreement shall survive any such termination.\n5. Suggestions and Feedback\nThe Receiving Party may from time to time provide suggestions, comments or other feedback (\"Feedback\") to the Disclosing Party with respect to Confidential Information provided originally by the Disclosing Party. Both parties agree that all Feedback is and shall be given entirely voluntarily. Feedback, even if designated as confidential by the party offering the Feedback, shall not, absent a separate written agreement, create any confidentiality obligation for the receiver of the Feedback. Furthermore, except as otherwise provided herein or in a separate subsequent written agreement between the parties, the receiver of the Feedback shall be free to use, disclose, reproduce, license or otherwise distribute, and exploit the Feedback provided to it as it sees fit, entirely without obligation or restriction of any kind on account of intellectual property rights or otherwise.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement.\n<TABLE>\n<S> <C>\nCOMPANY: STARBAND COMMUNICATIONS INC.

Each Patty understands and agrees that no contract or agreement providing for any Possible Transaction will be deemed to exist between the Parties unless and until a final definitive agreement has been executed and delivered, and each Party hereby waives, in advance, any claims (including breach of contract) in connection with any Possible Transaction unless and until the Parties will have entered into a final definitive agreement. The Parties also agree that unless and until a final definitive agreement regarding a Possible Transaction has been executed and delivered, neither Party will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to such a Possible Transaction by virtue of this Agreement, except for the matters specifically agreed to herein. The Company further reserves the right, in its sole discretion, with due notice to reject any and all proposals made by the Potential Relationship Party or any of its Representatives with regard to a Possible Transaction to determine not to engage in discussions or negotiations and to terminate discussions and negotiations with the Potential Relationship Party at any time, and to conduct, directly or through any of its Representatives, any process for any transaction involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries, if and as they in their sole discretion determine (including negotiating with any other interested parties and entering into a definitive agreement without prior notice to the Potential Relationship Party or any other person).

Grand\nSuite 3570\nLos Angeles, CA 90071\nDear Steven:\nYou have requested information regarding Home Products International, Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d, together with its subsidiaries and affiliates, is referred to herein as \u201cus\u201d or \u201cwe\u201d) in connection with your consideration of the possible acquisition of the Company (a \u201cPossible Transaction\u201d). In consideration of our furnishing you with the Evaluation Materials (as defined below) you agree as follows:\nConfidentiality of Evaluation Materials\nYou will treat confidentially any information (whether written or oral) that either we or our financial advisor, Mesirow Financial, Inc. (\u201cMesirow\u201d), or our other representatives furnish to you in connection with a Possible Transaction, together with analyses, compilations, studies or other documents prepared by you, or by your representatives (as defined hereinafter) which contain or otherwise reflect such information or your review of, or interest in, the Company (collectively, the \u201cEvaluation Materials\u201d). You recognize and acknowledge the competitive value of the Evaluation Materials and the damage that could result to the Company if the Evaluation Materials were used or disclosed except as authorized by this agreement\nThe term \u201cEvaluation Materials\u201d includes information furnished to you orally or in writing (whatever the form or storage medium) or gathered by inspection, and regardless of whether such information is specifically identified as \u201cconfidential\u201d. The term \u201cEvaluation Materials\u201d does not include information which, you establish through written documentation, (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by you or your representatives, (ii) was or becomes available to you on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Company or its representatives, provided that such source is not prohibited from disclosing such information to you by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation to the Company or its representatives, or (iii) is independently developed by you without violating your obligations hereunder. The terms of this section \u201cConfidentiality of Evaluation Materials\u201d shall remain in effect for 2 years from the effective date of this agreement.\nUse of Evaluation Materials\nYou will not use any of the Evaluation Materials for any purpose other than the exclusive purpose of evaluating a Possible Transaction. You and your representatives will keep the Evaluation Materials completely confidential; provided, however, that (i) such information may only be disclosed to those of your directors, officers, employees, affiliates, agents, representatives (including attorneys, accountants and financial advisors), and lenders (collectively, \u201cyour representatives\u201d) who need to know such information for the purpose of evaluating a Possible Transaction between you and the Company (it being understood that your representatives shall be informed by you of the confidential nature of such information and shall be directed by you, and shall each expressly agree (in writing, if requested by the Company or its advisors), to treat such information confidential in accordance with the agreement) and (ii) any other disclosure of such information may only be made if the Company consents in writing prior to any such disclosure. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that a Possible Transaction is not consummated, neither you nor your representatives shall use any of the Evaluation Materials for any purpose. In any event, neither you nor any of your representatives will use the Evaluation Materials in any way which is or may be detrimental to the Company. You will be responsible for any breach of this agreement by you or your representatives. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the Company reserves the right not to make available hereunder any information, the provision of which is determined by us, in our sole discretion, to be inadvisable or inappropriate or competitively sensitive.\nIn the event that you or any of your representatives received a request or are required (by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose all or any part of the Evaluation Materials, you or your representatives, as the case may be, agree to (i) immediately notify the Company of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such request, (ii) consult with the Company on the advisability of taking legally available steps to resist or narrow such request and (iii) assist the Company in seeking a protective order or other appropriate remedy. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained or that the Company waives compliance with the provisions hereof, you or your representatives, as the case may be, may disclose to any tribunal only that portion of the Evaluation Materials which you are advised by counsel is legally required to be disclosed, and shall exercise your best efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Evaluation Materials. The terms of this section \u201cUse of Evaluation Materials\u201d shall remain in effect for 2 years from the effective date of this agreement.\nNon-Disclosure\nThe disclosure of your possible interest in purchasing the Company could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business if for any reason an agreement of purchase and sale is not consummated or a disclosure is made prior to the closing of a Possible Transaction. Accordingly, unless required by applicable law or regulatory authority, you agree that prior to the closing of a Possible Transaction, without the prior written consent of the Company, you will not, and you will direct your representatives not to, disclose to any person (including, but not limited to, any customer, employee, supplier, creditor or competitor of the Company) the fact that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning a possible transaction between you and the Company or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any such Possible Transaction, including the status thereof, nor will you or any of your representatives make inquiry about the Company\u2019s business to any customer, employee, supplier, creditor or competitor of the Company. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you further agree that, without the prior written consent of the Company, you will not, directly or indirectly, enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding or any discussions that any lead to such agreement, arrangement or understanding with any person (other than the Company) regarding a Possible Transaction. The term \u201cperson\u201d as used in this agreement shall be broadly interpreted to include, without limitation, any corporation, the Company, governmental agency or body, stock exchange, partnership, limited liability company, association or individual. The terms of this section \u201cNon-Disclosure\u201d shall remain in effect for 2 years from the effective date of this agreement.\nSecurities Law Compliance\nYou acknowledge that the Evaluation Materials represent, in part, material, non-public information regarding the Company and its prospects. Accordingly, you acknowledge that you and your representatives understand that the securities laws of the United States prohibit any person who has material, non-public information concerning the Company or a Possible Transaction from purchasing or selling securities in reliance upon such information or from communicating such information to any other person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person is likely to purchase or sell such securities in reliance upon such information.\nReturn of Documents\nUpon the Company\u2019s request, you shall promptly deliver to the Company or destroy all written Evaluation Materials and any other written materials without retaining, in whole or in part, any copies, extracts or other reproductions (whatever the form or storage medium) of such materials, and shall certify the destruction of such materials in writing to the Company.\nNo Unauthorized Contact or Solicitation\nDuring the course of your evaluation, all inquiries and other communications are to be made directly to Mesirow or employees or representatives of the Company specified by Mesirow. Accordingly, you and your representatives agree not to directly or indirectly contact or communicate with any executive or other employee of the Company concerning a Possible Transaction, or to seek any information in connection therewith from such person, without the express written consent of Mesirow. You also agree not to discuss with or offer to any third party an equity participation in a Possible Transaction or any other form of joint acquisition by you and such third parry without the prior written consent of the Company.\nWithout the Company\u2019s prior written consent, neither you nor any of your affiliates will for a period of two years from the date of this agreement directly or indirectly solicit for employment or employ any of the officers or employees of the Company (or any person whose activities are dedicated to the Company).\nStandstill\nYou agree that until two years from the date of this agreement, without the prior approval of the Board of Directors of the Company, neither you nor any of your representatives will (i) acquire or make any proposal to acquire any securities or property of the Company, (ii) propose to enter into any merger or business combination involving the Company or purchase a material portion of the assets of the Company, (iii) make or participate in any solicitation of proxies to vote, or seek to advise or influence any person with respect to the voting of any securities of the Company, (iv) form, join or participate in a \u201cgroup\u201d (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) with respect to any voting securities of the Company, (v) otherwise act or seek to control or influence the management, Board of Directors or policies of the Company, (vi) disclose any intention, plan or arrangement inconsistent with the foregoing or (vii) take any action which might require the Company to make a public announcement regarding the possibility of a business combination or merger. Except as provided above, you also agree during such period not to request the Company (or its directors, officers, employees, agents or representatives) to amend or waive any provision of this paragraph.\nNo Representation or Warranty\nAlthough the Company and Mesirow have endeavored to include in the Evaluation Materials information known to them which they believe to be relevant for the purpose of your investigation, you acknowledge and agree that none of the Company, Mesirow or any of the Company\u2019s other representatives or agents is making any representation or warranty, expressed or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Materials, and none of the Company, Mesirow or any of the Company\u2019s other representatives or agents, nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives, stockholders, owners, affiliates, advisors or agents, will have any liability to you or any other person resulting from the use of Evaluation Materials by you or any of your representatives. Only those representations or warranties that are made to a purchaser in a definitive sale agreement for the Company (\u201cSale Agreement\u201d) when, as, and if it is executed, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be specified in such Sale Agreement, will have any legal effect. For purposes of this agreement, the term \u201cSale Agreement\u201d does not include an executed letter of intent or any other preliminary written agreement, nor does it include any oral acceptance of an offer or bid by you.\nYou also acknowledge and agree that no contract or agreement providing for the sale of the Company shall be deemed to exist between you and the Company unless and until a Sale Agreement has been executed and delivered by you and each of the other parties thereto, and you hereby waive, in advance, any claims (including, without limitation, breach of contract) in connection with the sale of the Company unless and until a Sale Agreement has been executed and delivered by you and each of the other parties thereto. You also agree that unless and until a Sale Agreement between the Company and you with respect to the acquisition of the Company has been executed and delivered by you and each of the other parties thereto, there shall not be any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to any such transaction by virtue of this agreement or any other written or oral expression with respect to such transaction except, in the case of this agreement, for the matters specifically agreed to herein.\nYou further understand and agree that (i) the Company and Mesirow shall be free to conduct the process for the Company\u2019s sale as they in their sole discretion shall determine (including, without limitation, negotiating with any of the prospective buyers and entering into a Sale Agreement without prior notice to you or to any other person), (ii) any procedures relating to such sale may be changed at any time without notice to you or any other person and (iii) you shall not have any claims whatsoever against the Company, Mesirow or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders, owners, affiliates, agents or representatives arising out of or relating to the sale of the Company.\nLegal Remedy\nYou understand and agree that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this agreement by you or your representatives and that the Company will be entitled to specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies for any such breach. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach of this agreement by you or your representatives but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity. You further agree not to raise as a defense or objection to the request or granting of such relief that any breach of this agreement is or would be compensable by an award of money damages and to waive any requirements for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy.\nOther\nThis agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto regarding the subject matter hereof This agreement may be changed only by a written agreement signed by the parties hereto or their authorized representatives.\nIf any term or provision of this agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms and provisions of this agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated.\nThe parties understand and agree that no failure or delay by the other party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or future exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder.\nThis agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois applicable to contracts made and to be performed therein. You irrevocably and unconditionally agree to submit to personal jurisdiction and service and venue exclusively in any federal or state court within the State of Illinois having subject matter jurisdiction over any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this agreement and the rights and obligations contained herein and waive any objection you may have to such jurisdiction, service and venue.\nIf you are in agreement with the foregoing, please sign and return one copy of this agreement, it being understood that all counterpart copies will constitute but one agreement with respect to the subject matter of this letter.\nVery truly yours,\nHOME PRODUCTS INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nBy MESIROW FINANCIAL, INC.

Without the prior written consent of the Company or except as may be required by applicable law or regulation, the Receiving Party and its Representatives shall not disclose to any person that any discussions or negotiations are taking place between the parties concerning a possible Transaction, including the content, timing and status of such discussions or negotiations (the \u201cDiscussion Information\u201d).\n5. No Representations by the Company. The Company will have the exclusive authority to decide what Confidential Information (if any) is to be made available to the Receiving Party and its Representatives. Neither the Company nor any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, consultants, advisors, attorneys, accountants and affiliates (collectively, the \u201cCompany Representatives\u201d) will be under any obligation to make any particular Confidential Information available to the Receiving Party or any of the Receiving Party\u2019s Representatives or to supplement or update any Confidential Information previously furnished.

No Representations by the Company. The Company will have the exclusive authority to decide what Confidential Information (if any) is to be made available to the Receiving Party and its Representatives.

      "text": "(ORACLE LOGO)\nCONFIDENTIAL DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT FOR STRATEGIC MATTERS\nThis Confidential Disclosure Agreement (\u201cAgreement\u201d) is entered into as of the effective date listed below (\u201cEffective Date\u201d) by Oracle Corporation (\u201cOracle\u201d) located at 500 Oracle Parkway, Redwood City, California 94065 and the company designated below (\u201cCompany\u201d).\nOracle and the Company are entering into discussions concerning a possible strategic transaction (the \u201cTransaction\u201d). The parties expect to make available to one another certain non-public, confidential and/or proprietary information, both oral and written, which may include information concerning their respective business prospects and plans, financial condition, technology, customers, know-how, trade secrets, operations, assets and liabilities (collectively, the \u201cEvaluation Material\u201d). As a condition to each party furnishing the Evaluation Material to the other party and the directors, officers, employees, agents or advisors of such party or its subsidiaries (collectively, \u201cRepresentatives\u201d), each party agrees that the Evaluation Material furnished to it hereunder shall be treated as confidential subject to the terms of this Agreement.\n1. Evaluation Material. \u201cEvaluation Material\u201d also includes notes, analyses, compilations, studies, plans, interpretations or other documents prepared by the receiving party or its Representatives which contain or are based upon the Evaluation Material furnished to such party hereunder. The term \u201cEvaluation Material\u201d does not include information that (i) is or becomes a matter of public knowledge through no fault of the receiving party; (ii) is or becomes available to the receiving party from a source other than the disclosing party or any of its Representatives, provided that such source was not known or reasonably should be known by the receiving party to be bound by a duty of confidentiality with respect to such information; (iii) is disclosed by the disclosing party to a third party without a duty of confidentiality; (iv) is independently developed by the receiving party without use of the Evaluation Material; or (v) is disclosed under operation of law.\n2. Non-Disclosure/Security/Use. Each party agrees that, without the prior written consent of the other party, neither it nor its Representatives will disclose to any other person any of the other party\u2019s Evaluation Material, the fact that discussions between the parties are taking place concerning the Transaction, or any terms or other facts relating to the Transaction and will use such Evaluation Materials only for the purpose of evaluating a Transaction. Each party agrees to use reasonable measures to protect against the loss, theft or unauthorized use of the Evaluation Materials.\n3. Personally Identifiable Information. The Evaluation Materials may include human resources data and/or other information that serves to identify one or more individuals (\u201cPII\u201d). The receiving party agrees to notify the disclosing party of any request received by the receiving party for access, correction, amendment or redaction of any PII. The disclosing party shall be responsible for compliance with all such requests. The receiving party also agrees to notify the disclosing party of any actual or suspected improper acquisition of PII of which the receiving party becomes aware.\n4. Residuals. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to limit either party\u2019s ability to use \u201cresiduals\u201d relating to the Evaluation Material of the other party. The term \u201cresiduals\u201d shall mean information included in the Evaluation Material in nontangible form (i.e., not written or other documentary form, including tape or disk), which is incidentally retained in the memories of employees of either party who have had access to the Evaluation Material, including ideas, know-how, or techniques contained therein, and where the source of the Evaluation Material has become remote (e.g., as a result of the passage of time or the employee\u2019s subsequent exposure to information of a similar nature from other sources) that the employee in good faith believes that it is not Evaluation Material. Neither party shall have any obligation to limit or restrict the assignment of its employees or to pay royalties to the other party in connection with any use of residuals.\n5. Independent Development. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to limit or preclude either party from developing, using, marketing, licensing, and/or selling any independently developed software, technology or other materials similar or related to the Evaluation Material without otherwise violating this Agreement.\n6. Required Disclosure. In the event that a party or its Representatives is required by Law, rule or stock exchange regulation to disclose any of the other party\u2019s Evaluation Material or the fact that discussions between the parties are taking place concerning the Transaction, the party required to make such disclosure shall, to the extent practicable, provide the other party with prior written notice of any such requirement so that the other party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. In the event that such protective order, other remedy or waiver is not obtained, the party required to make the disclosure shall furnish only that portion of the Evaluation Material that such party determines, alter consulting with counsel, is required to disclose and shall exercise all reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality of the other party\u2019s Evaluation Material.\n7.

Notwithstanding the return or destruction of the Evaluation Material, each party and its Representatives will continue to be bound by its obligations of confidentiality and other obligations hereunder for a period ending on the second anniversary of the Effective Date.\n8. Definitive Agreements.

      "text": "CONFIDENTIALITY AND STANDSTILL AGREEMENT\n This Confidentiality and Standstill Agreement (the \"Agreement\") is entered into as of this 7th day of March, 2001, by and between Polycom, Inc. (\"Polycom\"), and PictureTel Corporation (\"PictureTel\"), a Delaware corporation.\nWITNESSETH:\n WHEREAS, Polycom and PictureTel may consider engaging in discussions with respect to a possible negotiated business combination involving PictureTel and Polycom or their respective subsidiaries (the \"Transaction\") and, prior to or during the course of any such discussions, PictureTel and Polycom each may have disclosed or, in the future, may disclose and make available to the other certain information concerning its business prospects, financial condition, operations, assets and liabilities;\n WHEREAS, all such information furnished to a party or its Representatives (as defined below) by or on behalf of the other party (irrespective of the form of communication and whether such information is so furnished before, on or after the date hereof), and all analyses, compilations, data, studies, notes, interpretations, memoranda or other documents prepared by a party or its Representatives containing or based in whole or in part on any such furnished information are collectively referred to herein as the \"Confidential Information;\" and\n WHEREAS, each of Polycom and PictureTel hereby agrees to receive such Confidential Information of the other and to disclose such Confidential Information to the other subject to the following terms and conditions.\n NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the mutual promises and obligations contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:\n 1. Non-Disclosure of Confidential Information. (a) Each of PictureTel and Polycom shall (i) use the Confidential Information obtained from the other solely for the purpose of evaluating a possible Transaction and for no competitive or other purpose; (ii) not disclose the Confidential Information to any third party, except for disclosures to its directors, executive officers and representatives of its advisors (such as independent accountants, investment bankers, consultants and attorneys) acting on its behalf (collectively, its \"Representatives\") who in each case, in such party's reasonable judgment, need to know such information for the purpose of evaluating a possible Transaction and who are set forth on Annex A hereto, as it may be amended by the parties from time to time; (iii) inform its Representatives of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information and direct its Representatives to treat the Confidential Information confidentially and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; (iv) take all additional reasonable precautions necessary to prevent the disclosure of the Confidential Information by its Representatives to any third party; and (v) be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by its Representatives.\n (b) If either party is required (by interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any Confidential Information, it is agreed that such party will provide the other party with prompt notice of such request so that such other party may seek an appropriate protective order and/or waive the notifying party's compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. If, in the absence of a protective order, either party is nonetheless compelled to disclose Confidential Information, such party may disclose, without liability hereunder, only that portion of the Confidential Information that such party is advised in writing by outside legal counsel is legally required to be disclosed; provided that such party gives to the other party written notice of the portion of the Confidential Information to be disclosed as far in advance of its disclosure as is practicable and, upon such other party's request, uses reasonable efforts to obtain assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded to such information.\n 2. Non-Disclosure of Negotiations or Agreements. Except as required by law, neither PictureTel, Polycom nor their respective Representatives shall disclose to any person (including, without limitation, any director, officer or employee that is not set forth on Annex A) the existence, status or terms of any discussions, negotiations or agreements between them concerning a possible Transaction, including without limitation any offer, letter of intent, proposal, price, value or valuation, or any similar terms, agreements or understandings between PictureTel and Polycom with respect thereto, or that such party has provided to or received from the other Confidential Information, without obtaining the prior written consent of the other party. The term \"person\" as used in this Agreement will be interpreted broadly to include the media and any corporation, company, group, partnership or other entity or individual.\n 3. Ownership of Confidential Information. Each party shall keep a reasonable record of the Confidential Information received by it and the location of such Confidential Information. All written Confidential Information delivered by one party hereto to the other party pursuant to the Agreement shall be and remain the property of the delivering party, and upon the written request of the delivering party, the receiving party shall (i) promptly return such Confidential Information and shall not retain any copies or other reproductions or extracts thereof, (ii) destroy or have destroyed all memoranda, notes, reports, analyses, compilations, studies, interpretations, or other documents derived from or containing Confidential Information, and all copies and other reproductions and extracts thereof, and (iii) provide a certificate to the delivering party certifying that the foregoing materials have, in fact, been destroyed or returned, signed by an authorized officer supervising such destruction or return. Notwithstanding the return or destruction of the Confidential Information, each party and its Representatives will continue to be bound by the confidentiality and other obligations hereunder. Each party will keep a record of each person, other than its Representatives, that is afforded access to the other party and/or the Confidential Information of the other party, and before such access is afforded, each party agrees to inform such person of the requirements of this Agreement. Each party will furnish to the other party, upon request, a written copy of such record of such persons, other than its Representatives, that have been afforded access to the other party and/or the Confidential Information.\n 4. Information Not Deemed Confidential Information. The term \"Confidential Information\" does not include information that (i) is or becomes generally available to the public, other than, as a result of a disclosure by the receiving party or its Representatives in violation of this Agreement; (ii) is or becomes available to the receiving party from a source other than the delivering party or its Representatives, provided that such source is not known by the receiving party to be bound by an obligation of confidentiality to such delivering party or its Representatives; or (iii) was within the receiving party's possession prior to being furnished to the receiving party by or on behalf of the delivering party, provided that the person providing such information to the receiving party was not bound by a confidentiality agreement with the delivering party or otherwise prohibited from transferring such information to the receiving party by any contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation.\n 5. No Warranty. Neither PictureTel, Polycom nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives or agents makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy and completeness of any Confidential Information provided by it, and no liability shall result to the delivering party from its use, except as set forth in a definitive agreement for a Transaction. Only the representations and warranties that are made in a definitive agreement for a Transaction, when, as, and if it is executed, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be specified therein, shall have any legal effect.\n 6. No Agreement. Unless a definitive agreement regarding a Transaction between PictureTel and Polycom has been executed and delivered, neither Polycom, PictureTel nor any of their stockholders or affiliates will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to such a Transaction by virtue of this letter agreement or any other written or oral expression with respect to such Transaction except, in the case of this Agreement, matters specifically agreed to herein. Each party further acknowledges and agrees that each party reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reject any and all proposals made by the other party or any of its Representatives with regard to a Transaction, to deny any request for Confidential Information (regardless of the reasonableness of such request) and to terminate discussions or negotiations with the other party at any time. Neither this paragraph nor any other provision in this Agreement can be waived or amended except by written consent of PictureTel and Polycom, which consent shall refer specifically to this paragraph (or such other provision) and explicitly make such waiver or amendment.\n 7. Non Solicitation. Unless a Transaction is consummated, each party agrees that, for a period of eighteen (18) months from the date hereof, it will not hire or directly or indirectly solicit employment of (other than by means of a general advertisement) any of the\n(i) employees of the other party with whom it has had contact during the process contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) management level personnel or officers of the other party. It is expressly understood that this Agreement is not intended to preclude the ability of the parties to compete with one another in the ordinary course and that each party will arrange with the Principal, President or Chief Financial Officer of the other party (and no other individuals) for appropriate contacts for due diligence purposes. Unless otherwise agreed by either party, all (i) communications regarding a possible Transaction, (ii) requests for additional information, (iii) requests for facility tours or management meetings, or (iv) discussions or questions regarding procedures will be submitted or directed only to the President or Chief Financial Officer of the other party. Without the prior written consent of the President of the other party, neither party nor its Representatives will initiate, or cause to be initiated, any communication with any officer, director or employee of the other party concerning the Confidential Information or any possible Transaction.\n 8. Non-Public Information. PictureTel has outstanding publicly-held securities and the Confidential Information contains material non-public information. Each of the parties acknowledges that it is (i) aware, and has advised or will advise its Representatives, that the United States securities laws prohibit any person in possession of material non-public information about a company from purchasing or selling securities of such company, and from communicating such information to any other person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person may purchase or sell such securities and (ii) familiar with the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder, and each party agrees that it will neither use nor permit any of its Representatives to use any Confidential Information in violation of such Act or rules or regulations, including, without limitation, Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3.\n 9. Standstill. Each of the parties agrees that, until the expiration of eighteen months from the date of this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the Board of Directors or General Partners of the other party, it and its affiliates will not (i) in any manner acquire, agree to acquire or make any proposal or offer or otherwise seek to acquire, directly or indirectly any securities (or rights in respect thereof), assets or property of the other party or any of its subsidiaries, whether such agreements or proposals or offers are made with or to the other party (or any controlling person or successor thereof) or any of its subsidiaries; (ii) enter into or agree, offer, seek or propose to enter into or otherwise be involved in or part of, directly or indirectly, any merger, acquisition transaction or other business combination involving the other party or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective assets; (iii) make, or in any way participate in, directly or indirectly, any \"solicitation\" of \"proxies\" (as such terms are used in the proxy rules of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\")) to vote, or seek to advise or influence any person with respect to the voting of, any voting securities of the other party or any of its subsidiaries; (iv) form, join or in any way participate in a \"group\" (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) with respect to any voting securities of the other party or any of its subsidiaries; (v) otherwise act, alone or in concert with others, to seek or propose to control or influence the management, Board of Directors or policies of the other party; (vi) directly or indirectly enter into any discussions, negotiations, arrangements or understandings with any other person with respect to any of the foregoing activities or propose any of such activities to any other person; or (vii) publicly disclose any intention, plan or arrangement inconsistent with the foregoing; (viii) directly or indirectly advise, encourage, provide assistance (including debt or equity financial assistance) to or hold discussions with or invest in any other person in connection with any of the foregoing. Each party also agrees that, during such eighteen month period, neither it nor any of its affiliates will: (i) request the other party or its advisors, directly or indirectly, to (1) amend or waive any provision of this paragraph (including this sentence) or (2) otherwise consent to any action inconsistent with any provision of this paragraph (including this sentence); or (ii) take any initiative with respect to the other party or any of its subsidiaries that could reasonably be expected to require the other party to make a public announcement regarding (1) such initiative, (2) any of the activities referred to in this paragraph, (3) the possibility of a Transaction or any similar transaction or (4) the possibility of such party or any other person acquiring control of the other party, whether by means of a business combination or otherwise. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, this Section 9 shall not apply to a party in the event of a bona fide publicly announced proposal, offer or agreement by a third party not acting in concert with such party (i) to acquire more than 51% of any class of stock (or rights in respect thereof) of the other party or (ii) to acquire the other party, or all or substantially all of its assets, by means of a merger, consolidation, asset purchase or other similar transaction. Additionally, the Principal or President of a party may contact the Principal or President of the other party for the purpose of expressing continuing or renewed interest in a Transaction, provided that, unless invited to do so by the President of the other party, no offer or proposal shall be made that would require public disclosure or formal consideration by such other party or its Board of Directors.\n 10. No Waiver. No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof, or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder. Any waiver of a breach hereof shall be in writing and shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.\n 11. Remedies. Each party agrees to indemnify the other party from any damages, loss, cost or liability (including, without limitation, legal fees and the cost of enforcing this Agreement) arising out of or resulting from any unauthorized use or disclosures of any Confidential Information by the other party or its Representatives. It is understood and agreed that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by either party and that the non-breaching party shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including specific performance and injunction, as a remedy for any such breach. Each party agrees to waive, and to use its best efforts to cause its directors, officers, employees or agents to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Agreement by either party, but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity to the non-breaching party.\n 12. Governing Law. This Agreement is for the benefit of the parties and their respective directors, officers, employees, representatives and agents and their respective successors and assigns and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal substantive laws and not the choice of law rules of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n 13. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all such counterparts together shall constitute but one and the same Agreement.\n 14. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is found to violate any statute, regulation, rule, order, decision or decree of any governmental authority, court, agency or exchange, such invalidity shall not be deemed to affect any other provision hereof or the validity of the remainder of this Agreement, and such invalid provision shall be deemed deleted herefrom to the minimum extent necessary to cure such violation.\n Polycom, Inc.\n By:\n Name:\n Title:\n PictureTel Corporation\n By:\n Name:\n Title:\n",

      "text": "Exhibit (d)(5)\nPACKETEER, INC.\nTWO WAY NON-DISCLOSURE AND CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT\nTHIS Agreement is made and entered into by and between PACKETEER, INC. (\u201cPacketeer\u201d) and Blue Coat Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation, having offices at 420 North Mary Avenue, Sunnyvale, CA 94085, to assure the protection and preservation of the confidential and/or proprietary nature of each party\u2019s confidential information. Each party will disclose such information solely for the purpose of evaluating the possibility of entering into a business relationship between the parties hereto (the \u201cPurpose\u201d). In reliance upon and in consideration of the following undertakings, the parties agree as follows:\n1. Definition. Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 2, all information (including but not limited to ideas, techniques, works of authorship, models, inventions, know-how, processes, equipment, algorithms, software source documents and formulae related to the current, future, and proposed products and services of each of the parties and information concerning research, development, financial information, procurement requirements, purchasing, manufacturing, customer lists, business forecasts, sales and merchandising, and marketing plans), disclosed by one party (the \u201cDiscloser\u201d) to the other party (the \u201cRecipient\u201d) which is labeled or marked \u201cConfidential\u201d or with some other similar proprietary legend, or which, in the context of the disclosure, the Recipient has reason to believe is confidential, shall be deemed to be \u201cConfidential Information.\u201d If Confidential Information is disclosed in oral form, the Discloser shall identify it as confidential at the time of disclosure and thereafter summarize it in writing and transmit such summary to the Recipient within thirty (30) days of the oral disclosure.\n2. Exclusions. \u201cConfidential Information\u201d excludes information which: (a) is now or hereafter becomes generally known or available, through no act or failure to act on Recipient\u2019s part; (b) Recipient independently knows at the time of receiving such information; (c) a third party hereafter furnishes to Recipient without restriction on disclosure and without breach of any confidentiality obligations; (d) Recipient has independently developed without using any Confidential Information or breaching this Agreement; or (e) Discloser gives written permission to Recipient to disclose.\n3. Restrictions/Obligations. Recipient shall: (a) only disclose the Confidential Information to those employees and contractors with a need to know; provided that Recipient binds those employees and contractors to terms at least as restrictive as those stated in this Agreement (or, with respect to professional advisors, advises them of its obligations with respect to the Confidential Information); (b) not disclose any Confidential Information to any third party, without Discloser\u2019s prior written consent; (c) use such Confidential Information only to the extent required to accomplish the Purpose; (d) not reproduce Confidential Information in any form except as required to accomplish the Purpose; (e) not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any software disclosed by the Discloser; (f) not directly or indirectly export or transmit any Confidential Information to any country to which such export or transmission is restricted by regulation or statute; and (g) promptly provide the Discloser with notice of any actual or threatened breach of the terms of this Agreement. However, Recipient may disclose Confidential Information in accordance with a judicial or other governmental order provided that Recipient shall give Discloser written notice prior to such disclosure. Subject to Recipient\u2019s obligations of non-disclosure, Recipient shall be free to use the residuals resulting from the use or access to the Confidential Information of Discloser. The term \u201cresiduals\u201d means information in intangible form which is retained in the unaided memory of persons who have had access to the Confidential Information, without reference to such information in tangible or fixed form. Solely with respect to non-technical Confidential Information, Recipient\u2019s obligations under this Section 3 shall expire one (1) year from the date of disclosure of such non-technical Confidential Information.\n4. Ownership and Return of Confidential Information. All Confidential Information (including all copies thereof) shall remain the property of Discloser. All copies shall bear all proprietary markings contained on or in the originals. Upon the request of Discloser, Recipient shall, at Recipient\u2019s option, either (a) return such materials to Discloser, or (b) certify the destruction thereof.\n5. Rights. No rights or licenses to trademarks, inventions, copyrights, patents or any other intellectual property rights are implied or granted under this Agreement. Subject to the obligations of this Agreement, neither party will be precluded from independently developing technology or pursuing business opportunities similar to those covered by the Confidential Information disclosed hereunder. Each party retains sole discretion to assign or reassign the job responsibilities of its employees. Each party acknowledges that the other party may currently or in the future be developing information internally, or receiving information from third parties, that is similar to the Confidential Information. Nothing in this Agreement will prohibit Recipient from developing or having developed for it products, concepts, systems or techniques that are similar to those contemplated by or embodied in the Confidential Information, provided the Recipient does not violate its obligations under this Agreement.\n6. Term and Termination. This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect for a period of three (3) years unless terminated sooner as set forth below. This Agreement may be terminated by either party upon thirty (30) days written notice, provided however, that Paragraphs 3, 4, 5, and 7 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.\n7. Miscellaneous. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California. This Agreement contains the final, complete and exclusive agreement of the parties relative to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings and agreements relating to its subject matter and may not be changed, modified, amended or supplemented except by a written instrument signed by both parties. If any provision of this Agreement is found by a proper authority to be unenforceable, that provision shall be severed and the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect. Recipient hereby acknowledges and agrees that no remedy at law will afford Discloser adequate protection against, or appropriate compensation for, breach of Recipient\u2019s obligations under this Agreement. Accordingly, Recipient agrees that Discloser shall be entitled to specific performance of Recipient\u2019s obligations, as well as such further equitable relief as may be granted by a court of competent jurisdiction.

You will make reasonable and appropriate efforts to safeguard Evaluation Material from disclosure by you or your Representatives to anyone other than as permitted hereby by using, in all material respects, the same degree of care that you use to protect your own confidential, proprietary information. You agree to be responsible for any failure by your Representatives to comply with this Agreement (including, without limitation, any actions or inactions by your Representatives that would constitute a breach if such Representatives were original signatories hereto (other than with respect to paragraph 7 below under the heading \u201cNon-Solicitation and Non-Hire of Employees\u201d)).\n2.

If you determine that you do not wish to proceed with a Transaction or your evaluation hereof, you will promptly advise the Company of that decision. In that case, or if at any time the Company so requests in writing, you will promptly (and in any event within 10 days) either, at your option, (i) deliver to the Company all of the Evaluation Material (including all copies, reproductions, summaries, analyses or extracts thereof or based thereon) in your possession or in the possession of any of your Representatives or\n(ii) destroy or cause to be destroyed all such Evaluation Material in your possession or in the possession of any of your Representatives (such destruction to be acknowledged by you in writing to the Company). Notwithstanding such delivery or destruction of the Evaluation Material, you agree that you and your Representatives will continue to be bound by your obligations under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) you and your Representatives will not be required to delete, erase or destroy any Evaluation Material contained in an archived computer backup system stored as a result of automated back-up procedures (it being agreed that you and your Representatives will not access such archived computer files containing any such Evaluation Material after such delivery or destruction is otherwise required) and (ii) you and/or your Representatives may retain one copy of the Evaluation Material (and may only access any such Evaluation Material) to the extent and for so long as such retention and access by you or such Representative, as applicable, is required by law or regulation; provided, however, that in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) of this sentence, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, you and your applicable Representatives will continue to be bound by the terms of this Agreement as if it were in full force and effect with respect to any such Evaluation Material for so long as you or your applicable Representatives retain any such Evaluation Material.\nNo Unauthorized Contact\n11. Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Company, all (i) communications regarding any possible Transaction, (ii) requests for additional information or Evaluation Material, (iii) requests for facility tours or management meetings and (iv) discussions or questions regarding procedures relating to a possible Transaction, will be submitted or directed to only the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company, the chairperson of the Board of Directors of the Company or those officers of the Company designated to you in writing by the Company. You further agree that, except as permitted by this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the Company, you and your Representatives will not contact any other officers, directors, employees, stockholders, customers or suppliers of the Company or its subsidiaries in connection with a possible Transaction, and, without limiting anything in this Agreement, will not otherwise disclose to any such parties the fact that the Company or its affiliates may pursue a Transaction with you or other parties or that discussions or negotiations have taken or may take place concerning a possible Transaction.\nMaintaining Privileges\n12. If any Evaluation Material includes materials or information subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or threatened legal proceedings or governmental investigations, you understand and agree that you and the Company have a commonality of interest with respect to such matters and it is the desire, intention and mutual understanding of each party to this Agreement that the sharing of such material is not intended to, and will not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or its continued protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege. All Evaluation Material provided to you that is entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege will remain entitled to such protection under these privileges, this Agreement and the joint defense doctrine. Nothing in this Agreement obligates any party to reveal material subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege.\nExport Restrictions\n13. You acknowledge that certain of the Evaluation Material may be subject to export restrictions under U.S. law. You will not, and will cause your Representatives not to, without the express written permission of the Company, transmit, directly or indirectly, any Evaluation Material that is subject to such export restrictions to any person or country outside the United States or otherwise in violation of applicable law; provided, however, that you will not be deemed to be in violation of this provision in connection with any Evaluation Material provided directly by the Company or its Representatives to your employees who have a Randstad email address other than one ending in \u201crandstadusa.com\u201d. The Company will advise you in writing as to the applicability of this Section 13 to any particular piece of Evaluation Material at or before the time such material is provided to you.\nNo Obligation, Representation or Warranty\n14. This Agreement defines the duties and obligations of you and your Representatives with respect to the Evaluation Material to the extent it may be disclosed or made available but does not constitute or create any obligation of the Company or its Representatives to provide any Evaluation Material or other information to you. Under no circumstances will the Company or any of its Representatives be obligated to disclose or make available any information, including, without limitation, any Evaluation Material, which the Company in its sole and absolute discretion determines not to disclose. Except for any express representations and warranties set forth in a definitive agreement providing for a Transaction and subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of any such agreement, you understand and acknowledge that none of the Company or any of their respective Representatives is making any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Material or any other information provided to you or your Representatives by or on behalf of the Company, and none of the Company or any of their respective Representatives will have any liability to you or any other person (including, without limitation, any of your Representatives) resulting from your use of the Evaluation Material or any errors therein or omissions therefrom, except as may otherwise be set forth in any definitive agreement providing for a Transaction and subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of any such agreement.\n15. You acknowledge and agree that neither you nor the Company, nor any of either party\u2019s Representatives, will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to any Transaction by virtue of (i) this Agreement or (ii) any written or oral expression or communication with respect to any Transaction by any of the Company\u2019s Representatives except, in the case of this Agreement, for the matters specifically agreed to herein. You further acknowledge and agree that (a) the Company will be free to conduct the process for a Transaction as the Company in its sole discretion will determine (including, without limitation, negotiating with any other person and entering into a definitive agreement without prior notice to you or any other person), (b) none of you, the Company, or any of your or their respective Representatives will have any legal, fiduciary or other duty to the other party or its Representatives with respect to any such process, and none of you, the Company, or each party\u2019s respective Representatives are relying on any express or implied representation concerning the manner in which such process will proceed, (c) any of the procedures relating to a Transaction may be changed at any time without notice to you or any other person, (d) each party will have the right to reject or accept any potential proposal, offer or participant therein, for any or no reason whatsoever, in its sole discretion and (e) neither party will have any claim whatsoever against the other or any of their respective Representatives arising out of or relating to a Transaction, except as may otherwise be set forth in any definitive agreement providing for a Transaction and subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of any such agreement.\nTerm\n16. Except as otherwise provided herein, the obligations of the parties under this Agreement will terminate eighteen (18) months from the date hereof, provided that such termination will not relieve any party from its responsibilities in respect of any breach of this Agreement prior to such termination.\nActing as Principal\n17. You represent and warrant that you (i) are acting as a principal in any possible Transaction, (ii) are not represented by any broker or similar party other than Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, which company is acting as your financial advisor in connection with a possible Transaction, (iii) are not acting as a broker for or Representative of any other person in connection with the Transaction, and (iv) are considering the Transaction only for your own account. Except with the prior written consent of the Company, you agree that (a) you will not act as a joint bidder or co-bidder with any other person with respect to the Transaction, and (b) neither you nor any of your Representatives (acting on behalf of you or your subsidiaries) will enter into any discussions,\nnegotiations, agreements, arrangements or understandings (whether written or oral) with any other person regarding the Transaction, other than the Company and its Representatives, and your Representatives (to the extent permitted hereunder).\nLegal Remedy\n18. You acknowledge that money damages and remedies at law may be inadequate to protect the Company against any actual or threatened breach of or failure to comply with this Agreement by you or by your Representatives and, without prejudice to any rights and remedies otherwise available to the Company, you may agree to the seeking of specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable remedies in the Company\u2019s favor, and you further agree to waive, and to cause your Representatives to waive, any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with any such remedy.\nGoverning Law\n19. The validity and interpretation of this Agreement will be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to conflicts of laws principles. You irrevocably (i) submit to the jurisdiction of any court of the State of New York located in New York, New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York for the purpose of any suit, action, or other proceeding arising out of this Agreement, or any of the transactions contemplated hereby (each a \u201cProceeding\u201d) and agree that service of any process, summons, notice or document delivered by hand or sent by U.S. registered mail to your address set forth above will be effective service of process for any action, suit or proceeding brought against you in any such court, (ii) agree that all claims in respect of any Proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court, (iii) irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any immunity you have acquired, or hereafter may acquire, from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process therein, (iv) irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any right to trial by jury in any Proceeding and (v) agree not to commence any Proceeding other than in such court, and waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any claim that any such Proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum.\nNo Waiver\n20. No failure or delay by the Company in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement will operate as a waiver thereof nor will any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power or privilege.\nSuccessors and Assigns\n21. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto. You may not assign this Agreement or any part hereof without the prior written consent of the Company, and any purported assignment without such consent will be null and void.\nSeverability\n22. If it is found in a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction (not subject to further appeal) that any term or provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, (i) the remaining terms and provision hereof will be unimpaired and will remain in full force and effect to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and (ii) the invalid or unenforceable term or provision will be replaced by a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the parties\u2019 intention with respect to such invalid or unenforceable term or provision.\nEntire Agreement\n23. This Agreement embodies the entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto and supersedes any and all prior agreements, arrangements and understandings relating to the matters provided for herein. This Agreement may not be amended or modified in any manner nor may any of its provisions be waived except by written amendment executed by the parties. An amendment or modification or waiver will only be effective if (i) it is in writing and signed by the Company and you, (ii) it specifically refers to this Agreement and (iii) it specifically states that the Company and/or you, as the case may be, is amending, modifying or waiving its rights hereunder. Any such amendment, modification or waiver will be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which it was given.\nData Site\n24. The terms of this Agreement shall supersede any additional purported confidentiality requirements imposed by any offering memorandum, web-based database or similar repository of Evaluation Material to which you or any of your Representatives may be granted access in connection with the evaluation, negotiation or consummation of the Transaction, notwithstanding acceptance of such an offering memorandum or submission of an electronic signature, \u201cclicking\u201d on an \u201cI Agree\u201d icon or other indication of assent to such additional confidentiality conditions, it being understood and agreed that your confidentiality obligations with respect to Evaluation Material are exclusively governed by this Agreement and may not be enlarged except by a written agreement that is hereafter executed by each of the parties hereto.\nCounterparts\n25. For the convenience of the parties hereto, any number of counterparts of this Agreement may be executed by the parties hereto, each of which will be an original instrument and all of which taken together will constitute one and the same Agreement. Delivery of a signed counterpart of this Agreement by e-mail or facsimile transmission will constitute valid and sufficient delivery thereof.\nThis Agreement is being delivered to you in duplicate.

Nothing in this Section 4, or any other provision of this Agreement, shall be construed to prohibit Employee from reporting conduct to, providing truthful information to, or participating in any investigation or proceeding brought or conducted by any federal or state government agency or self-regulatory organization.\nEmployee specifically acknowledges that the Confidential Information, whether reduced to writing or maintained electronically or in the mind or memory of Employee and, whether compiled by a Banking Organization and/or the Employee, derives independent economic value from not being readily known to or ascertainable by proper means by others who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, that reasonable efforts have been put forth by each Banking Organization to maintain the secrecy of such information, that such information is the sole property of such Banking Organization and that any retention and/or use of such information during or after Employee\u2019s employment with either Financial Institution (except in the course of performing the Employee\u2019s duties of employment with a Financial Institution and except as otherwise set forth above) constitutes a misappropriation of a Banking Organization\u2019s Confidential Information.\nEmployee agrees that all Confidential Information and all records, documents and materials relating to all Confidential Information (including all copies thereof) shall be and remain the sole and exclusive property of a Banking Organization, and upon Employee\u2019s termination of employment, all such Confidential Information, whether in paper or electronic form, shall be returned to a Financial Institution in good condition, without Employee retaining a copy thereof, including, but not limited to, retaining an electronic copy on any electronic device regardless of whether such device is owned by Employee. At a Financial Institution\u2019s request, Employee shall provide written verification, under the penalties for perjury, of his/her compliance with this covenant.\n5. Non-Solicitation of Customers and Potential Customers. Employee acknowledges and agrees that by virtue of Employee\u2019s position with a Banking Organization, Employee has or will have advantageous familiarity and personal contacts with Customers and Potential Customers and will have advantageous familiarity with the business operations and affairs of a Banking Organization. Employee further acknowledges and agrees that Employee has been or will be placed in a position that, were Employee to leave a Financial Institution to compete with the business of a Banking Organization, such entity from which the Employee departed would, upon violation of this Agreement, suffer irreparable harm and financial loss, as well as lost goodwill and Confidential Information. Therefore, in consideration of the covenants of all Financial Institutions contained herein, Employee agrees that during Employee\u2019s employment with a Financial Institution, and for a period of one (1) year immediately following the termination of Employee\u2019s employment with a Financial Institution (\u201cRestriction Period\u201d), for whatever reason and regardless of how Employee\u2019s employment was terminated, Employee shall not, directly or indirectly (including, but not limited to, through other individuals, any partnership, corporation or business entity in which Employee has an ownership interest or serves as an officer, employee, independent contractor, representative, agent or consultant), either for Employee\u2019s own benefit or the benefit of any other Person:\na. Solicit, divert, or take away (or attempt to Solicit, divert or take away) any Banking and Financial Services to or from any Customer or Potential Customer; or\nb. advise, persuade or induce (or attempt to advise, persuade or induce) any Customer or Potential Customer to terminate, reduce, limit, or change the Customer\u2019s services or business relationship, or the Potential Customer\u2019s contemplated services or business relationship, with a Financial Institution; or\nc. directly provide Banking and Financial Services to, or directly accept Banking and Financial Services from, any Customer or Potential Customer.\nThis Agreement is not intended to prevent Employee from accepting employment with an organization that competes with the Banking Organizations by offering Banking and Financial Services to Customers or Potential Customers. The Parties acknowledge that Employee may be associated with such an Organization and that such association may place Employee in a senior or supervisory role to those in the organization that have contact with Customers or Potential Customers. Employee shall not be in violation of this Agreement merely by engaging in such a role, which may include:\na. supervising those who provide Banking and Financial Services to Customers or Potential Customers;\nb. engaging in credit review, underwriting, loan approval, or financial analysis of a Customer or Potential Customer\u2019s business as a part of a supervisory or management role, so long as such activity does not require the disclosure of Confidential Information, direct contact with the Customer or Potential Customer, or the disclosure of Employee\u2019s role to the Customer or Potential Customer;\nc. performing or supervising those that perform data processing, accounting, rate review, document review or similar \u201cback room\u201d services related to a Customer or Potential Customer so long as the services do not require the disclosure of Confidential Information or contact with the Customer or Potential Customer.\n6. Non-Solicitation of Employees and Others. In consideration of the covenants of all Financial Institutions contained herein, Employee agrees that during Employee\u2019s employment with a\nFinancial Institution, and for a period of two (2) years immediately following the termination of Employee\u2019s employment with a Financial Institution, for whatever reason and regardless of how Employee\u2019s employment was terminated, Employee shall not, directly or indirectly (including, but not limited to, through other individuals, any partnership, corporation or business entity in which Employee has an ownership interest or serves as an officer, employee, independent contractor, representative, agent or consultant), either for Employee\u2019s own benefit or the benefit of any other Person:\nc. Solicit, entice or persuade (or attempt to Solicit, entice or persuade) any Employee to terminate his or her employment with a Banking Organization, or offer or provide employment (whether such employment is with Employee or any other Person) either on a full-time or part-time, consulting or Independent Contractor basis; or\nd. Solicit, entice or persuade (or attempt to Solicit, entice or persuade) any Independent Contractors or Agents to terminate their contract or relationship with a Banking Organization or discontinue providing services to a Banking Organization and/or Customers; or\ne. Solicit, entice or persuade (or attempt to Solicit, entice or persuade) any suppliers, vendors or others who were supplying services or goods to a Banking Organization during the one year period prior to Employee\u2019s termination, to terminate, reduce, limit or change their business or relationship with a Banking Organization.\n7. Tolling of Covenants. Employee acknowledges that a Banking Organization is entitled to the full post-termination restrictions on the activities set forth in Sections 5 and 6, as applicable. Therefore, in the event any of the provisions of these Sections are breached by Employee, the commencement of the applicable post-termination restriction will not begin until Employee is in full compliance with Section 5 and/or 6.\n8. Severability/Blue Pencil. Each of the provisions of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the restrictive covenants in Sections 5 and 6, are distinct and severable, notwithstanding that the covenants may be set forth in one section for convenience. If any provision of this Agreement shall be determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in whole or in part, for any reason, neither the validity of the remaining part of such provision nor the validity of any other provision of this Agreement shall in any way be affected. Should any particular restrictive covenant, provision or clause of this Agreement be held unreasonable or unenforceable for any reason, including without limitation, the time period, geographic area and/or scope of activity covered by such covenant, provision or clause, the parties acknowledge and agree that such covenant, provision or clause shall be given effect and enforce to whatever extent would be reasonable and enforceable under applicable law. The parties expressly authorize a court of competent jurisdiction to modify or revise such provision to limit the covenants to cover the maximum period of time, range of activities or other restrictions as would be enforceable under Indiana law.\n9. Available Relief. Employee agrees that a Banking Organization, or its successor or assigns, will suffer irreparable damage and injury and will not have an adequate remedy at law in the event of any breach by Employee of any provision of Sections 4, 5 or 6, herein. Accordingly, in the event of a breach or of a threatened or attempted breach by Employee of Sections 4, 5, or 6, in addition to all other remedies to which a Banking Organization is entitled under law, in equity, or otherwise (including, but not limited to, monetary damages), a Banking Organization or its assigns and successors, shall be entitled to a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary or permanent injunction (without the necessity of showing any actual damage) or a decree of specific performance and no bond or other security shall be required in that connection.\n10. Enforcement/Attorneys\u2019 Fees. In any action that is brought to enforce or interpret this Agreement, the prevailing party or its assigns and successors, shall be entitled to recover their reasonable attorneys\u2019 and paralegal fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith. If a Banking Organization or its assigns and successors, institute any action or proceeding to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, Employee hereby waives all claims or defenses that a Banking Organization or its assigns and successors, have an adequate remedy at law, and Employee shall not urge in any such action or proceeding the claim or defense that such a remedy at law exists.\n11. Assignments; Successors and Assigns. The rights and obligations of Employee hereunder are not assignable or delegable by Employee, and any prohibited assignment or delegation will be null and void. The Banking Organization may, without the consent of the Employee, assign this Agreement to any successor or in connection with any merger, consolidation, share exchange, combination, sale of stock or assets or similar transaction. The provisions hereof shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors and assigns of a Banking Organization.\n12. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be interpreted under, subject to and governed by the laws of the State of Indiana, without consideration of the choice of law principles thereof, and all questions concerning its validity, construction and administration shall be determined in accordance with Indiana law.\n13. Entire Agreement/Modification/Waiver. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and expressly supersedes any prior agreements between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall not be terminated, amended or modified without the prior written consent of the Bank\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer and Employee. No failure or delay by a Banking Organization in exercising any right or remedy under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver by a Banking Organization under this Agreement operate or be construed as a continuing waiver or a waiver of any subsequent breach or noncompliance hereunder. No single or partial exercise of any right or remedy by a Banking Organization shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy. Any waiver by a Banking Organization under this Agreement shall be in writing and signed by the Bank\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer. A waiver shall operate only as to the specific term or condition waived and will not constitute a waiver for the future or act on anything other than that which is specifically waived.\n14. \u201cNo-Defense\u201d Provision. The covenants set forth in this Agreement are essential terms and conditions to a Banking Organization employing or continuing to employ Employee, and shall be construed as independent of any other obligations or agreements between Employee and a Banking Organization. The existence of any claim or cause of action Employee may have against a Banking Organization, including, but not limited to, the alleged material breach by a Banking Organization of any agreement with Employee, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by a Banking Organization of the covenants and obligations in this Agreement and shall not relieve Employee of his or her obligations under this Agreement.\n15. Jurisdiction and Venue. The parties agree that all suits, actions, proceedings, litigation, disputes, or claims relating to or arising out of this Agreement shall be filed and tried in the Superior or Circuit Court, as appropriate, of Vigo County, Indiana, or the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, Terre Haute Division. In this regard, the parties hereby: (a) agree that venue shall be such stated courts; (b) irrevocably consent to service of process and to the jurisdiction and venue of such courts; and (c) irrevocably waive any claim of inconvenient forum if any such suit, claim, proceeding, litigation, dispute, or claim has been filed, brought, or made in any of such courts.\n16. Construction. This Agreement is the result of negotiations between the parties, and no party shall be deemed to be the drafter of this Agreement; accordingly, this Agreement shall be interpreted and construed without any presumption or inference based upon or against the party causing this Agreement to be prepared. The language of this Agreement shall in all cases be construed as a whole, according to its fair meaning and not strictly for or against any party.\n17. Review and Consultation. Employee acknowledges and agrees that he/she has read this Agreement in its entirety prior to executing it, understands the provisions and effects of this Agreement, and has consulted with or had the opportunity to consult with an attorney or other advisers as he/she deemed appropriate in connection with the execution of this Agreement.\n18. Section Headings. Section headings are inserted into this Agreement for convenience only and shall not affect any construction or interpretation of this Agreement.\n19. Reasonableness. Employee agrees and acknowledges that the covenants, restrictions and obligations set forth in this Agreement, including Sections 5 and 6, are reasonable and necessary to protect a Banking Organization. Employee agrees that the covenants, restrictions and obligations will not affect Employee\u2019s ability to make a living.\n20. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of identical counterparts, each of which shall be deemed a duplicate original but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement. The parties agree that signatures transmitted by facsimile or other electronic means are acceptable the same as original signatures for the execution of the Agreement.\n21. Miscellaneous. Any change in Employee\u2019s duties, responsibilities, title, position, compensation, or status, with a Financial Institution will not affect the validity or enforceability of this Agreement.\n22. Representations. Employee represents and warrants that he/she is not a party to an agreement with his or her prior employer(s) (other than Heritage or HopFed) or any other Person that prohibits Solicitation of business or competing with that employer or other Person. Employee affirms and represents that performance of his/her job duties and responsibilities for a Financial Institution does not, and will not, breach any agreement or covenant not to Solicit business, compete in business, or keep in confidence proprietary or confidential information acquired in confidence or in trust prior to Employee\u2019s employment with a Financial Institution. Employee further represents that he/she has not retained any documents or information relating to Employee\u2019s prior employers (other than Heritage or HopFed) that may be considered confidential or proprietary information and that Employee has not disclosed or used, and will not disclose or use, any information relating to his or her prior employer(s) in connection with Employee\u2019s employment with a Financial Institution.\n23. Return of Property. Upon termination of Employee\u2019s employment, Employee shall immediately return to the Bank (if subsequent to the Effective Time) or Heritage (if prior to the Effective Time), all Banking Organizations documents and property, including, but not limited to, Confidential Information, computer discs, manuals, reports, files, memoranda, records, door and file keys, passwords and access codes, and any other physical or tangible things that Employee received, prepared, or helped prepare in connection with the Employee\u2019s employment, and Employee shall not retain any copies, duplicates, reproductions or excerpts thereof. At the Bank\u2019s or Heritage\u2019s request, Employee shall provide written verification under the penalties for perjury of his/her compliance with this covenant.\n24. Survival. Except as set forth below, the covenants in Sections 4, 5, 6 and 23 shall survive the termination of Employee\u2019s employment with a Financial Institution regardless of the reason for termination. If the Merger is not consummated and the Merger Agreement is terminated, Sections 4, 5, 6 and 23 shall survive with respect to First Financial and the Bank, but shall not survive with respect to HopFed or Heritage.\n[Signature Page to Follow]\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the date indicated below.\nFIRST FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nBy: /s/ Norman L.

In consideration of the mutual promises and covenants contained herein, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:\n1. \u201cConfidential Information\u201d shall mean the Purpose (including the contemplated transaction), identity of, and any discussions or negotiations between, the Parties, existence of this Agreement, and any and all information whether in oral, written, graphic or electronic form, including but not limited to, data, know-how and any and all subject matter (whether patentable or not, including without limitation any derivatives thereof) pertaining to Verenium\u2019s research, financial data, sales information, inventions, development, materials, technology, trade secrets, work in process, marketing, business plans, regulatory information and strategies, scientific, engineering and/or manufacturing processes or equipment, protocols, assays, strains, compounds, genes, gene pathways, enzymes, peptides, the commercial applications of genes, gene pathways, enzymes, peptides, accessing microbial diversity, manipulating and modifying genes and gene pathways, identifying bioactive compounds through recombinant techniques and any other elements of Verenium\u2019s business which Verenium considers to be of value, including its present or future products, projections, sales, pricing, customers, employees, investors and contractual relationships.\n2. Subject to the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Agreement, (i) Company, as recipient of Confidential Information from or on behalf of Verenium, shall use such Confidential Information solely for the Purpose and for no other purpose or use, and (ii) Company shall not disclose to any third party any Confidential Information received from or on behalf of Verenium hereunder. Upon discovery of any loss or unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information, Company shall immediately notify Verenium.\n3. Company agrees to treat Confidential Information received from or on behalf of Verenium, with at least the same degree of care that Company uses to protect its own Confidential Information. Company shall only disseminate Confidential Information to such of its Representatives with a special need to know for carrying out the Purpose of this Agreement. In addition, Company hereby agrees that such Representatives shall be informed of the confidential and proprietary nature of the Confidential Information received and that such Representatives shall be bound by the terms hereof or subject to confidentiality and non-use obligations no less restrictive than those set forth herein. Company shall be liable for any disclosure or use of the Confidential Information by its Representatives in a manner not authorized by this Agreement. \u201cRepresentative\u201d means any employee, consultant, contractor, officer, agent, advisor, and/or director of a Party. \u201cAffiliate\u201d for purposes of this Agreement shall mean any one or more business entities which are: (a) owned or controlled by, (b) owning or controlling, or (c) under common control with a Party at the time in question. Ownership, direct or indirect, of more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting stock or other equity interests of an entity ordinarily entitled to vote in the election of directors or similar governing body of an entity shall, without limitation, constitute ownership or control thereof.\n4. The Company shall have no obligations to Verenium with respect to the use of such information, or disclosure to others not party to this Agreement, of such information which: (a) prior to disclosure was rightfully known to or in the possession of Company as evidenced by Company\u2019s competent written records and not subject to any confidentiality or non-disclosure obligations or restrictions; (b) is or becomes publicly known during the time period in which Company\u2019s duties and obligations hereunder extend, through no fault, unauthorized act or omission of Company or its Representatives; (c) was provided without restriction on disclosure by a third party who had the lawful right to make such disclosure and where such disclosure was not in violation of any obligation, contractual or otherwise, owed by such third party to Verenium; (d) is rightfully and in good faith developed by Company independently of any disclosures made under this Agreement, as evidenced by Company\u2019s competent written records; or (e) is required by applicable law, regulation or bona fide legal process to be disclosed by Company, provided, however, that Company takes all reasonable steps to restrict and maintain the confidentiality of such disclosure (including, without limitation, seeking a protective order or confidential treatment thereof, as the case may be), and provides reasonable prior written notice to Verenium of the requirement to disclose such information and the specific disclosure(s) proposed to satisfy such law(s), regulation(s) or legal process(es).\n5. Confidential Information shall not be reproduced by Company in any form except as required to accomplish the intent of this Agreement. Any reproduction of any Confidential Information by Company shall remain the property of Verenium unless otherwise authorized in writing by Verenium.\n6. Company agrees, upon request, to promptly return or destroy all items relating to Confidential Information, including but not limited to, all materials, written materials, drawings, data and records provided or otherwise made available by Verenium, and all copies (in any form) thereof, with a certificate of compliance with the foregoing, executed by an appropriate officer of Company within 30 days of such request, provided that the Company may maintain a single copy of such Confidential Information within its Legal Department for archival purposes. Notwithstanding the return or destruction of Confidential Information, Company and its Representatives shall continue to be bound by the obligations hereof.\n7. All right, title and interest in and to Confidential Information shall be retained by Verenium and nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any license or right under any patent or other intellectual property rights, or other rights, or representing any commitment by either Party to enter into any additional agreement, by implication or otherwise, or creating any partnership, joint venture or agency relationship. All Confidential Information provided hereunder is provided \u201cAS IS\u201d and without any warranty, express, implied, or otherwise, regarding its accuracy or performance. Verenium shall have no liability to Company of any nature or kind whatsoever, directly or indirectly, resulting from or arising out of the reliance or use by Company of any Confidential Information.\n8. Company acknowledges that it is aware, and will advise its Representatives who are informed of the Purpose or who review Confidential Information, of the restrictions imposed by the United States securities laws on the purchase or sale of Verenium\u2019s securities by any person who has received material, non-public information about Verenium and on the communication of such information to any other person when it is reasonably foreseeable that such other person is likely to purchase or sell such securities in reliance upon such information.\n9. During the one-year period commencing on the date of this Agreement (the \u201cStandstill Period\u201d), neither the Company nor any of its Representatives will, in any manner, directly or indirectly (except to the extent agreed by Verenium): (a) make, effect, initiate, cause or participate in (i) any acquisition of beneficial ownership of any securities of Verenium or any securities of any subsidiary or other Affiliate of Verenium, in excess of five (5) percent of the outstanding securities of any such company (with any such acquisition, regardless of size, only being made at such time as neither the acquiring party nor any of its Affiliates is in possession of material, non-public information about Verenium), (ii) any acquisition of any assets of Verenium or any assets of any subsidiary or other Affiliate of Verenium, (iii) any tender offer, exchange offer, merger, business combination, recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation, dissolution or extraordinary transaction involving Verenium or any subsidiary or other Affiliate of Verenium, or involving any securities or assets of Verenium or any securities or assets of any subsidiary or other Affiliate of Verenium, or (iv) any \u201csolicitation\u201d of \u201cproxies\u201d (as those terms are used in the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission) or consents with respect to any securities of Verenium; (b) form, join or participate in a \u201cgroup\u201d (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules promulgated thereunder) with respect to the beneficial ownership of any securities of Verenium; (c) act, alone or in concert with others, to seek to control or influence the management, board of directors or policies of Verenium; (d) take any action that might require Verenium to make a public announcement regarding any of the types of matters set forth in clause \u201c(a)\u201d of this sentence; (e) agree or offer to take, or encourage or propose (publicly or otherwise) the taking of, any action referred to in clause \u201c(a)\u201d, \u201c(b)\u201d, \u201c(c)\u201d or \u201c(d)\u201d of this sentence; (f) assist, induce or encourage any other person or entity to take any action of the type referred to in clause \u201c(a)\u201d, \u201c(b)\u201d, \u201c(c)\u201d, \u201c(d)\u201d or \u201c(e)\u201d of this sentence; or (g) enter into any discussions, negotiations, arrangement or agreement with any other person or entity relating to any of the foregoing. The expiration of the Standstill Period will not terminate or otherwise affect any of the other provisions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Company and its Representatives shall not be precluded from submitting a topping or other offer or otherwise participating in any process not initiated by the Company or its Affiliates or Representatives in which the securities or assets of Verenium or any subsidiary or other Affiliate of Verenium are for sale or are being or have been sold, and (ii) upon filing for protection under US Bankruptcy laws by Verenium or any subsidiary or Affiliate of Verenium the restrictions of this paragraph 9 shall be void and of no further force or effect with respect to the filing entity.\n10. This Agreement shall constitute the entire understanding between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and may be modified only in writing and signed by both Parties; provided, however, that any restrictions set forth on the Company or its Affiliates in any previous confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements between the Parties or their Affiliates shall remain in place for the periods set forth in any such agreements. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. This Agreement, and rights and obligations hereunder, shall not be assigned. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective successors, assigns, personal representatives, executors and administrators.\n11. Company acknowledges that its breach of this Agreement will cause irreparable damage to Verenium and hereby agrees that Verenium shall be entitled to injunctive relief under this Agreement for such breach or threatened breach as well as such further relief as may be granted by a court of competent jurisdiction.\n12. This Agreement shall commence as of the Effective Date and shall terminate one (1) year thereafter, unless earlier terminated upon 30 days written notice to the other Party; provided, however, that the duties set forth in paragraphs 9 and 13 shall survive for the periods set forth in paragraphs 9 and 13 and the Company\u2019s duties and obligations to protect Confidential Information disclosed during the term (or any extension) of this Agreement shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for a period of five (5) years. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Company\u2019s duties and obligations to protect a trade secret disclosed hereunder shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement indefinitely.\n13. During the one-year period commencing on the date of this Agreement (the \u201cNon-Solicitation Period\u201d), Company shall not, nor shall it permit its Affiliates or Representatives, to: (a) hire any employee of Verenium or enter into a contract with any employee of Verenium to provide services to Company (or any of its Affiliates), in each case involving an employee of Verenium with whom Company has contact as a result of this Agreement or discussions relating to a possible transaction between the Parties, without obtaining the prior written approval of Verenium, or (b) directly or indirectly, induce or attempt to induce or otherwise solicit, counsel, discuss, advise or encourage any such employee to leave or otherwise terminate such employee\u2019s relationship with Verenium; provided, however, that the foregoing provisions of this paragraph 13 shall not apply to any employee of Verenium who was previously terminated by Verenium or who responds to a general solicitation or advertisement regarding employment with Company or its Affiliates. The expiration of the Non-Solicitation Period will not terminate or otherwise affect any of the other provisions of this Agreement.\n14. All notices or reports permitted or required under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be delivered by personal delivery, electronic mail, facsimile transmission or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, and shall be deemed given upon personal delivery, five (5) days after deposit in the mail, or upon acknowledgment of receipt of electronic or facsimile transmission. Notices shall be sent to the addresses set forth at the beginning of this Agreement or such other address as a Party may specify in writing to the other Party. Each Party represents and warrants that it has the authority to undertake the obligations set forth in this Agreement without breaching or violating any contractual or statutory obligation owed to another. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws principles.\nACCEPTED AND AGREED as of the date first written above.\nBASF CORPORATION Verenium Corporation\nBy: /s/ Fried-Walter M\u00fcnstermann By: /s/ Jeffrey G.

Actuate and Company intend to discuss a potential business relationship.\nEach undersigned party (the \u201cReceiving Party\u201d) and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, or advisors (including, without limitation, legal advisors, accountants, consultants, bankers, and financial advisors) and potential sources of financing (collectively, \u201cRepresentatives\u201d) understands that during these discussions the other party (the \u201cDisclosing Party\u2019\u2019) may disclose Proprietary Information (as defined herein) relating to the Disclosing Party\u2019s business.\nIn consideration of the parties\u2019 discussions and any access the Receiving Party may have to Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party hereby agrees as follows:\n1. As used herein, the term \u201cProprietary Information\u201d refers to any and all Information of a confidential, proprietary, or secret nature which is applicable to or related In any way to (i) the business, present or future, of the Disclosing Party, (ii) the research and development or investigations of the Disclosing Party or (iii) the business of any customer of the Disclosing Party; provided, in each case, that such information is delivered to the Receiving Party by the Disclosing Party and (a) is marked or identified in writing as \u201cConfidential\u201d, (b) if verbal or visual disclosure, is identified as \u201cConfidential\u201d in a writing within ten (10) business days of such disclosure, or (c) is information that the Receiving Party actually knew or reasonably should have known was confidential.

Proprietary Information shall also include all information of a like nature owned by any other person and furnished to the Disclosing Party by such other person pursuant to an undertaking by the Disclosing Party to maintain the same in confidence.\n2. The Receiving Party agrees (a) to hold the Disclosing Party\u2019s Proprietary Information In strict confidence and to take all reasonable precautions to protect such Proprietary Information (including, without limitation, all precautions that Receiving Party employs with respect to its confidential materials), (b) not to divulge any such Proprietary Information or any information derived therefrom to any third person without prior written permission of the Disclosing Party, excluding disclosure to Representatives, (c) not to make any use whatsoever at any time of such Proprietary Information except to evaluate internally whether to enter into the contemplated business relationship with the Disclosing Party, and (d) not to copy or reverse engineer any such Proprietary Information. Any employee given access to any such Proprietary Information must have a legitimate \u201cneed to know\u201d and be subject to restrictions on disclosure of Proprietary Information practically identical to the terms set forth herein. Without granting any right or license, the Disclosing Party agrees that the foregoing clauses (a), (b) and (c) shall not apply with respect to any information that (i) is or (through no improper action or inaction by the Receiving Party or any agent, consultant or employee) becomes generally available to the public, or (ii) was or is rightfully in Receiving Party\u2019s possession or the possession of any of its Representatives or was known by it or its Representatives without restriction prior to receipt from the Disclosing Party, or (iii) was or is rightfully disclosed to Receiving Party or any of its Representatives by a third party provided the Receiving Party complies with restrictions imposed by the third party, or (iv) was or is independently developed without use of any Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party. The Receiving Party and its Representatives may make disclosures required by court order or any legal or judicial process, without any liability hereunder, provided the Receiving Party uses reasonable efforts to limit disclosure and to obtain confidential treatment or a protective order and has allowed the Disclosing Party to participate In the proceeding to the extent legally permissible and reasonably practicable.\n3. Promptly upon receipt of a written request by the Disclosing Party at any time (which will be effective if actually received or three days after mailed first class postage prepaid to the Receiving Party\u2019s address herein), the Receiving Party will turn over to the Disclosing Party, or, at its sole discretion, destroy and certify to the Receiving party in writing the destruction of all Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party and all documents or media containing any such Proprietary Information and any and all copies or extracts thereof; provided, however, the Company and its Representatives shall not be obligated to return or destroy Proprietary Information to the extent otherwise required by law, regulation, rule or practice governing professionals or any internal compliance policy or procedure required by law, regulation rule of practice governing professionals.

Except to the extent required by law, neither party shall disclose the existence or subject matter of the negotiations or business relationship contemplated by this Agreement.\n5. The parties acknowledge and agree that due to the unique nature of the possible transaction between the parties, there can be no adequate remedy at law for any material breach of this Agreement, that any such breach may allow the breaching party or third parties to unfairly compete with the non-breaching party, resulting in irreparable harm to the non-breaching party, and therefore, that upon any such breach or any threat thereof, the non-breaching party shall be entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever remedies it might have at law. The Receiving Party will notify the Disclosing Party In writing immediately upon the occurrence of any unauthorized release or other breach of which it is aware.\n6. The parties expressly agree that neither the terms or conditions of this Agreement, nor the discussions held by the parties to address the feasibility of a potential business relationship shall be construed as to prevent either party from pursuing similar discussions with third parties in similar markets or obligate either party to take, continue or forgo any action relating to the above-mentioned discussions. Further, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as prohibiting or restricting either party from independently developing, acquiring, and marketing products, services, and other materials, which are similar to or competitive In any geographic area and in any form with the other party\u2019s product(s) or service(s). However, this paragraph shall not be deemed to grant to either party any license under the other party\u2019s copyrights or patents.\n7.

No waiver or modification of this Agreement will be binding upon either party unless made in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of such party and no failure or delay in enforcing any right will be deemed a waiver.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the day and year set forth below.\n[Signature page follows.]\nDate: July 24, 2014\nACTUATE CORPORATION OPEN TEXT CORPORATION\nBy: /s/ Thomas McKeever By: /s/ Gordon A.

      "text": "ORACLE\nCONFIDENTIAL DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT FOR STRATEGIC MATTERS\nThis Confidential Disclosure Agreement (\u201cAgreement\u201d) is entered into as of the effective date listed below (\u201cEffective Date\u201d) by Oracle Corporation (\u201cOracle\u201d) located at 500 Oracle Parkway, Redwood City, California 94065 and the company designated below (\u201cCompany\u201d).\nOracle and the Company are entering into discussions concerning a possible strategic transaction involving the Company and/or its shareholders (the \u201cTransaction\u201d). In connection with these discussions, the parties expect to make available to one another certain non-public, confidential and/or proprietary information, which may include information concerning their respective business prospects and plans, financial condition, technology, operations, assets and liabilities (collectively, the \u201cEvaluation Material\u201d). As a condition to each party furnishing the Evaluation Material to the other party and the directors, officers, employees, agents or advisors of such party or its subsidiaries or other affiliates (collectively, \u201cRepresentatives\u201d), each party agrees that the Evaluation Material furnished to it hereunder shall be treated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.\n1. Evaluation Material. \u201cEvaluation Material\u201d also includes notes, studies analyses, compilations, plans, interpretations or other documents prepared by the receiving party or its Representatives to the extent that they contain or are based upon the Evaluation Material furnished to such party hereunder. The term \u201cEvaluation Material\u201d does not include information that (a) is or becomes a matter of public knowledge or is generally available to the public not through a breach of this Agreement; (b) is or becomes available to the receiving party from a source other than the disclosing party or any of its Representatives, provided that such source was not known by the receiving party to be bound by a duty of confidentiality with respect to such information; (c) is disclosed by the disclosing party to a third party without a duty of confidentiality; or (d) is independently developed by the receiving party without use of the Evaluation Material.\n2. Non-Disclosure; Use. Each party agrees that, without the prior written consent of the other party, neither it nor its Representatives will disclose to any other person (other than to such party\u2019s Representatives who agree, or are otherwise bound, not to disclose the following except as contemplated by this Agreement) any of the other party\u2019s Evaluation Material, the fact that discussions between the parties are taking place concerning the Transaction, or any terms or other facts relating to the Transaction. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Evaluation Material shall only be used by a party and its Representatives to evaluate, negotiate, facilitate or pursue a Transaction.\n3. Personally Identifiable Information. To the extent that its Evaluation Material includes human resources data and/or other information that serves to identify one or more individuals (\u201cPII\u201d), the disclosing party agrees to provide only such information as is required for evaluating or planning for a possible Transaction and to provide any notices and obtain any consents necessary for the receiving party to store and access such PII globally and to use PII in connection with the Transaction. The receiving party agrees to notify the disclosing party of any request received by the receiving party for access, correction, amendment or redaction of any PII. The disclosing party shall be responsible for compliance with all such requests. The receiving party also agrees to notify the disclosing party of any actual or suspected improper acquisition of PII of which the receiving party becomes aware.\n4. Residuals. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to limit the ability of either party or any of its Representatives to use \u201cresiduals\u201d relating to the Evaluation Material of the other party. The term \u201cresiduals\u201d shall mean information of any kind included in or relating to the Evaluation Material which is retained in the memories of Representatives of either party who have had access to the Evaluation Material, including ideas, know-how, or techniques contained therein, but not as a result of any deliberate effort to memorize the information. Without limitation of the foregoing, neither party shall have any obligation to limit or restrict the assignment of its employees or to pay royalties to the other party in connection with any use of residuals.\n5. Independent Development. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to limit or preclude either party from developing, using, marketing, licensing, and/or selling any independently developed software, hardware, technology or other materials similar or related to the Evaluation Material.\n6. Required Disclosure. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in the event that a party or its Representatives receives a request or is required (by law, rule, regulation, deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil demand or other process) to disclose any of the other party\u2019s Evaluation Material or any of the other information referred to in section 2 hereof (irrespective of the reason for any such request or requirement), the party requested or required to make such disclosure shall, to the extent reasonable and practicable, provide the other party with prior written notice of any such request or requirement so that the other party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. In the event that such order, remedy or waiver is not obtained, the party requested or required to make the disclosure may disclose only that portion of the Evaluation Material or other information that such party, in the opinion of counsel, is required to disclose.\n7. Return of Materials; Termination. Promptly upon written request from the other party, each party shall return or destroy (at the receiving party\u2019s option) all copies of the Evaluation Material (including all documents based thereon) in its or its Representatives\u2019 possession, provided, that the receiving party shall only be required to use commercially reasonable efforts to return or destroy any Evaluation Material created pursuant to its or its Representatives\u2019 standard electronic backup and archival procedures. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the receiving party and each of its Representatives may each retain one copy of the Evaluation Material to show compliance with this Agreement or to comply with applicable law, rule or regulation (or, in the case of a party\u2019s advisors, professional standards). Notwithstanding the return or destruction of the Evaluation Material, each party and its Representatives will continue to be bound by its obligations of confidentiality. This Agreement and all rights and obligations hereunder shall terminate on the second anniversary of the Effective Date; provided, however, that sections 4, 5 and 7 through 12 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.\n8. Definitive Agreements. Unless and until a final definitive agreement regarding the Transaction has been executed by the parties, no agreement with respect to the Transaction shall be deemed to exist between the parties and neither party will be under any obligation whatsoever with respect to the Transaction by virtue of this Agreement or any oral expression except for the matters specifically agreed to herein. The term \u201cdefinitive agreement\u201d does not include a term sheet or any other preliminary written agreement. Each party reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to provide or not provide Evaluation Material under this Agreement, to reject any and all proposals and to terminate discussions and negotiations at any time.\n9. Entire Agreement. This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement with respect to the Evaluation Material disclosed hereunder and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements concerning such Evaluation Material, whether written or oral. All additions or modifications to this Agreement must be made in writing and must be signed by both parties.\n10. Miscellaneous. Each party agrees to be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of its Representatives. In case any provision of this Agreement shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of the Agreement shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts.\n11. Governing Law; Jurisdiction. All matters arising out of, or relating to this Agreement shall be governed by the procedural and substantive laws of the State of Delaware without regard to any conflicts of law principles. The parties irrevocably and unconditionally agree (a) that any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement shall be instituted exclusively in any state or federal court in Delaware, (b) to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts, and (c) that venue is proper in such courts in any such action or proceeding.\n12. Waiver. No failure or delay by either party or any of its Representatives in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement will operate as a waiver thereof, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege will preclude any other or future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege under this Agreement.\nORACLE CORPORATION\nBy: /s/ Douglas Kehring\nName: Douglas Kehring\nTitle: Authorized Signatory\nEffective Date: 12/5/2013\nRESPONSYS, INC.\nBy: /s/ Julian Ong\nName: Julian Ong\nTitle: General Counsel\nAddress: 1100 Grundy Lane, 3rd Floor\n San Bruno, CA 94066\n",

      "text": "NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nTHIS NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT, dated as of July 22, 2008, is by and between Financial Investments Corporation (\u201cInvestor\u201d) and Taylor Capital Group, Inc. (together with its wholly-owned subsidiary, Cole Taylor Bank, the \u201cCompany\u201d).\nWHEREAS, Investor has expressed an interest in discussing with the Company a possible financing transaction being considered by the Company (a \u201cTransaction\u201d);\nWHEREAS, in connection with such discussions, the Company may disclose Evaluation Material (as defined below) to Investor; and\nWHEREAS, the Company would not disclose the Evaluation Material to Investor, nor discuss with the Investor the possibility of a Transaction, unless Investor executed and delivered this Agreement to the Company, and the Company may be irreparably harmed if Investor or any of its Representatives (as defined below) were to take any of the actions prohibited under this Agreement.\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt, sufficiency and adequacy of which is hereby acknowledged, intending to be legally bound, Investor and the Company hereby agree as follows:\n1. Evaluation Material. For purposes of this Agreement, the term \u201cEvaluation Material\u201d shall mean any and all information provided to Investor by or on behalf of the Company in connection with the Transaction whether in writing, orally, visually, electronically or in machine readable form, through demonstration or in any other manner, and shall include, without limitation, any information regarding or relating to the Company\u2019s operations, business opportunities, costs, finances, personnel, marketing and promotion plans, financial statements, financial information and business practices or policies, and any other business information of the Company or the terms or existence of this Agreement, the Company\u2019s consideration of a possible Transaction or any discussions between the parties with respect thereto, transmitted by or on behalf of the Company to Investor in connection with the Transaction, whether prior to or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and whether or not such information is marked \u201cconfidential\u201d. The term \u201cEvaluation Material\u201d does not include, and the obligations hereunder do not apply to, information, knowledge or data which (i) was in Investor\u2019s or its Representatives\u2019 (as defined below) possession prior to disclosure by the Company, or (ii) was or becomes available to Investor or its Representatives on a non-confidential basis from a party other than the Company provided that such party is not known to Investor, after reasonable inquiry, to be under an obligation of confidentiality to the Company with respect to such information, or (iii) at the time of disclosure or thereafter is generally available to the public (other than as a result of disclosure by Investor or its Representatives in violation of this Agreement), or (iv) Investor can demonstrate has been independently developed by it or on its behalf without reliance on the Evaluation Material. All Evaluation Material transmitted by or on behalf of the Company shall remain the sole property of the Company.\n2. Use of Evaluation Material. The Evaluation Material will be used by Investor solely in connection with its evaluation of a possible Transaction, and not for any other purpose whatsoever. The Evaluation Material will be kept confidential by Investor in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and will not be disclosed to any person, except that Investor may disclose the Evaluation Material or portions thereof to those of its employees, officers, directors, partners, members, affiliates, accountants, attorneys, agents, consultants and advisors (these persons being collectively called \u201cRepresentatives\u201d) who (a) need to know such information in order for Investor to be\nable to evaluate a possible Transaction and (b) have been directed by Investor to treat the Evaluation Material in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the term \u201cRepresentatives\u201d as applied to Investor shall not include any potential principal, co-investor or source of equity financing that is not a party to this Agreement. Investor shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of its Representatives. Neither Investor nor any of its Representatives shall, directly or indirectly, (x) market or use (other than as permitted by the Agreement) any Evaluation Material, (y) reproduce or otherwise copy any Evaluation Material except in connection with the Transaction, or (z) disclose, sell, license, offer to sell or license or otherwise transfer or make available any Evaluation Material to any person other than as otherwise permitted by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Investor will use all reasonable efforts to protect the confidentiality of Evaluation Material, including, without limitation, efforts commensurate with those it employs for the protection of its own confidential and proprietary information. The term \u201cperson\u201d as used in this Agreement will be interpreted broadly to include, without limitation, any agency, corporation, individual, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture or other entity.\n3. Exceptions. If Investor or its Representatives receive a subpoena or other validly issued administrative or judicial process requesting Evaluation Material, or if Investor or its Representatives are requested or required to disclose any Evaluation Material under law, governmental order, judicial order, regulatory or statutory requirement, discovery request, oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process, Investor shall notify the Company reasonably promptly following Investor or its Representatives first becoming aware of such requested disclosure, so that the Company may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy or, in the Company\u2019s sole discretion, waive compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Furthermore, if the Company seeks such a protective order or other appropriate remedy in connection with a third-party request or requirement to disclose the Evaluation Material, Investor and its Representatives will not oppose such efforts. In the event that no such protective order or other remedy is obtained, or that the Company waives compliance with the terms of this Agreement, and Investor or its Representatives are advised by legal counsel that they are legally compelled to make such disclosures, Investor or its Representatives, as the case may be, (i) may without liability hereunder furnish only that portion of the Evaluation Material or other information regarding a possible Transaction that Investor or its Representatives are advised by legal counsel is legally required, (ii) will give the Company notice of the disclosures to be made to the extent legally permissible and (iii) will, if applicable, request that confidential treatment be accorded the Evaluation Material or other information regarding a possible Transaction so disclosed to the extent legally permissible; it being understood and agreed that there can be no such assurance that the tribunal or governmental or similar authority will grant any such request.\n4. No Warranty. ALL EVALUATION MATERIAL IS PROVIDED \u201cAS IS,\u201d AND THE COMPANY HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING ITS ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, PERFORMANCE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS OR ITS MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n5. No Legal Obligation, Representation, or Warranty. The parties agree that, unless and until a binding agreement is entered into between the Company and Investor with respect to the Transaction, neither the Company nor Investor will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to the Transaction by virtue of this or any other written or oral expression, except with respect to the matters specifically agreed to herein. Nothing contained in any discussions between Investor and the Company or in any Evaluation Material shall be deemed to constitute a representation or warranty. Except for the matters set forth in this Agreement or in any such binding agreement, neither party shall be entitled to rely on any statement, promise, agreement, or understanding, whether oral or written, or any custom, usage of trade, course of dealing, or conduct.\n6. Return of Evaluation Material. At any time upon the written request of the Company, Investor will, at its own expense,\n(i) reasonably promptly redeliver to the Company or, at the at Investor\u2019s option, destroy all copies (including permanently erasing or deleting any electronic copies) of the Evaluation Material in the possession or control of Investor or any of its Representatives and\n(ii) reasonably promptly destroy all analyses, notes, data, compilations, summaries, forecasts, studies or other documents and materials prepared by Investor or any of its Representatives in connection with their evaluation and review of a possible Transaction that contain, reflect or are based upon or generated from, in whole or in part, any of the Evaluation Material. Upon the Company\u2019s written request, Investor will confirm any such destruction to the Company in writing. Notwithstanding the return or destruction of Evaluation Material, Investor will continue to be bound by its obligations of confidentiality hereunder respecting Evaluation Material, including without limitation, with respect to oral Evaluation Material and their obligation not to use any Evaluation Material for any purpose other than as specifically permitted in this Agreement.\n7. Non-Solicitation. For a period of eighteen months from the date of this Agreement, Investor will not, without the Company\u2019s prior written consent, directly or indirectly, solicit for purposes of employment, offer to hire or offer to enter into any contract with any executive officer of the Company with whom Investor has contact, or of whom Investor otherwise becomes aware, during its discussions with the Company or its evaluation of a possible Transaction; provided, however, that this paragraph shall not prohibit Investor from engagement in any general advertising or general solicitation not targeted to the Company\u2019s employees; and provided, further, that Investor shall not be prohibited from soliciting or hiring any such employee whose employment has been terminated by the Company or its affiliates.\n8. Standstill. For a period of eighteen months from the date of this Agreement, and except in connection with the Transaction, Investor will not, directly or indirectly, and Investor will cause any person controlled by Investor not to, without the prior written consent of the Board of Directors of the Company, (i) in any manner acquire, agree to acquire or make any proposal to acquire, directly or indirectly, any securities or property of the Company or any of its affiliates, (ii) propose to enter into, directly or indirectly, any merger, consolidation, recapitalization, business combination, partnership, joint venture or other similar transaction involving the Company or any of its affiliates, (iii) make, or in any way participate in any \u201csolicitation\u201d of \u201cproxies\u201d (as such terms are used in the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission) to vote, or seek to advise or influence any person with respect to the voting of any voting securities of the Company or any of its affiliates, (iv) form, join or in any way participate in a \u201cgroup\u201d (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) with respect to any voting securities of the Company or any of its affiliates, (v) otherwise act, alone or in concert with others, to seek to control or influence the management, Board of Directors or policies of the Company, (vi) disclose any intention, plan or arrangement inconsistent with the foregoing or (vii) advise, assist or encourage any other person in connection with any of the foregoing. Investor also agrees during such period not to (x) request the Company, directly or indirectly, to amend or waive any provision of this paragraph (including this sentence), (y) take any action that would reasonably be expected to require the Company or any of its affiliates to make a public announcement regarding this Agreement or the possibility of a Transaction, or (z) communicate with the Company\u2019s stockholders (other than communications with any of the officers of the Company, and any other employees of the Company designated by such officers, in the manner contemplated by this Agreement) regarding the subject matter of this Agreement.\n9. Acknowledgement. Investor acknowledges that it is aware, and that it will advise its Representatives who receive the Evaluation Material, that the United States securities laws prohibit any person who has received from an issuer material, non-public information from purchasing or selling securities of such issuer (and options, warrants and rights relating thereto) or from communicating such information to any other person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person is likely to purchase or sell such securities.\n10. Public Disclosure. Each of the Company and Investor acknowledge and agree that it will not, and it will cause its respective employees, representatives, affiliates and agents not to, publicly disclose, confirm or acknowledge the existence, or terms and conditions, of this Agreement, or the fact that the Company may be considering a possible Transaction with Investor, other than in a press release approved by each party hereto or as otherwise specifically agreed in writing by the parties hereto, except to the extent the Company believes in good faith, after consultation with counsel, it is required by any law, rule or listing requirement to make such disclosure, provided that the Company shall not identify the Investor or any of its affiliates by name without the Investor\u2019s consent.\n11. No License. Investor acknowledges and agrees that nothing contained in this Agreement will be construed as granting any rights, by license or otherwise, to Investor or any of its Representatives to any Evaluation Material, or to any copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patent rights, trade secrets, or other proprietary rights of the Company.\n12. Third-Party Contacts. Neither Investor nor any of its Representatives shall knowingly contact any employee (other than the officers of the Company and other employees designated by such officers in the manner contemplated by this Agreement), supplier or customer of the Company regarding the Transaction or the Company\u2019s prospects, without the Company\u2019s prior written consent.\n13. No Commitment. Each of the Company and Investor understands and agrees that no contract or agreement or binding obligation providing for or with respect to any Transaction shall be created or deemed to exist unless and until a definitive agreement has been executed and delivered with respect thereto, and that, unless and until a definitive agreement between the parties has been executed and delivered, no party has any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever to enter into or pursue a Transaction by virtue of this Agreement or any other written or oral expression, whether before or after the execution of this Agreement.\n14. Equitable Remedies. Investor hereby agrees that a failure to comply with any provision of this Agreement would cause the Company irreparable harm and that monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy for an actual or threatened breach of this Agreement by Investor or any of its Representatives because of the difficulty of ascertaining the amount of damage that will be suffered by the Company in the event that this Agreement is breached. Accordingly, the Company will be entitled to specific performance of this Agreement and injunctive or other equitable relief as a remedy for any such breach without proof of actual damages. Investor further agrees to waive, and to use its reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives to waive, any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with any such remedy. Any such equitable remedy shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedy for a breach of this Agreement, but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity to the Company.\n15. Authority. By signing below, each of the undersigned representatives of the parties hereto represents and warrants that he or she has full authority to execute this Agreement on his or her respective party\u2019s behalf and to bind his or her respective party to the terms of the Agreement.\n16. No Waiver. No course of action or failure to act by either party will constitute a waiver by a party of any right or remedy under this Agreement, and no waiver by either party of any right or remedy under this Agreement will be effective unless made in writing.\n17. Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law. However, if any provision of this Agreement is prohibited or invalid under any applicable law, such provision will be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity without invalidating the remainder thereof or any of the remaining provisions of this Agreement.\n18. Governing Law; Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois, without reference to its conflicts of law principles. Each party consents to the jurisdiction of the state or federal courts in Cook County, Illinois, which will be the sole venue for resolution of all disputes related to this Agreement. THE PARTIES HERETO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN CONNECTION WITH ANY MATTER ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT.\n19. Entire Agreement; Successors and Assigns. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between Investor and the Company regarding the matters set forth herein, and no representations or promises have been made that are not fully set forth herein. This Agreement shall be binding solely on and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.\n20. Counterparts; Facsimile Transmission. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which shall serve as an original, but all of which shall constitute but one agreement. For purposes of executing this Agreement, any signed documents transmitted by facsimile machine with automatic confirmation of receipt shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original document. The signature of any party transmitted by facsimile machine shall be considered to be an original signature and any such document shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as an original document executed, delivered and exchanged between the parties. At the request of any party, any executed document delivered by facsimile machine shall be re-executed by all parties in a \u201chard-copy\u201d form. The parties hereto hereby agree that none of them shall raise the use of a facsimile machine for the transmission of signatures as a defense to this Agreement and each such party hereby waives such defense.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the undersigned has caused this Non-Disclosure Agreement to be executed by its duly authorized representative.\nFinancial Investments Corporation\nBy: /s/ HARRISON I.

      "text": "MUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AND NON-SOLICITATION AGREEMENT\n This Mutual Non-Disclosure and Non-Solicitation Agreement (this \"Agreement\"), is made as of September 17, 2001 between EarthLink, Inc. a Delaware corporation (\"EarthLink\"), and PeoplePC, Inc., a Delaware corporation (\"PeoplePC\"). EarthLink and PeoplePC are sometimes referred to herein individually as a \"Party\" and collectively as the \"Parties.\"\n 1. Purpose. EarthLink and PeoplePC wish to have discussions relating to a potential transaction (the \"Transaction\") between EarthLink (and/or its subsidiaries and stockholders) and PeoplePC (and/or its subsidiaries and stockholders). In the course of such discussions, each Party expects to make available to the other Party and its Representatives (as defined herein) Evaluation Material (as defined herein) concerning the businesses, financial condition, operations, assets, properties, liabilities, and prospects of such Party. As a condition to making such information available, each Party is entering this Agreement and agrees that all Evaluation Material received by it or its Representatives from the other Party or any of its Representatives shall be treated in accordance with this Agreement.\n 2. Certain Definitions. As used in this Agreement: (i) the term \"Receiving Party\" means the Party receiving Evaluation Material; (ii) the term \"Furnishing Party\" means the Party providing Evaluation Material or causing Evaluation Material to be provided; (iii) the term \"Representatives\" means the directors, officers, employees, agents or advisors (including, without limitation, attorneys, accountants, investment bankers, financial advisors and other consultants and advisors engaged in connection with the review and evaluation of the Transaction) of the specified Party; and (iv) the term \"Evaluation Material\" means all proprietary and confidential information concerning the Furnishing Party or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, whether in verbal, visual, written, electronic or other form, which is made available by the Furnishing Party or any of its Representatives to the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives (\"Primary Evaluation Material\"), together, in each case, with all notes, memoranda, summaries, analyses, studies, compilations and other writings relating thereto or based in whole or in part thereon prepared by the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives (\"Derivative Evaluation Material\"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term \"Evaluation Material\" shall not include, and the Parties' obligations herein (other than their obligations under paragraph 6 of this Agreement) shall not extend to information which (a) was rightfully in the possession of the Receiving Party prior to disclosure by the Furnishing Party; (b) was or is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of the Evaluation Material; (c) is now or hereafter becomes available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by the Receiving Party or any of the Receiving Party's Representatives in violation of this Agreement; (d) becomes available to the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Furnishing Party or any of its Representatives and such source is not, to the knowledge of the Receiving Party following reasonable inquiry, under any obligation to the Furnishing Party or any of its Representatives (whether contractual, legal or fiduciary) to keep such information confidential; or (e) is transmitted by or on behalf of the Furnishing Party after receiving written notification from the Receiving Party of the termination of discussions relating to the Transaction or written instructions from the Receiving Party not to furnish any further Evaluation Material.\n 3. Confidentiality and Use of Evaluation Material.\n (a) Confidentiality of Evaluation Material. All Evaluation Material (i) shall be used solely for the purpose of evaluating and considering the Transaction; (ii) shall be kept strictly confidential by the Receiving Party; and (iii) shall be provided by the Receiving Party solely to those of its Representatives to whom disclosure is reasonably required to facilitate the Receiving Party's evaluation or consideration of the Transaction, it being the intention of the Parties to restrict the dissemination of Evaluation Material to as small a working group as practicable. The Parties agree that all Evaluation Material is and shall remain the property of the Furnishing Party. Before providing access to Evaluation Material to any Representative, the Receiving Party shall inform such Representative of the confidentiality of the Evaluation Material, and shall advise such Representative that, by accepting possession of or access to such information, such Representative is agreeing to be bound by this Agreement. Each Party shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of its Representatives.\n (b) Compulsory Disclosure of Evaluation Material. If the Receiving Party or its Representatives are requested or required in any judicial, arbitral or administrative proceeding or by any governmental or regulatory authority to disclose any Evaluation Material (whether by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand, or otherwise), or the Receiving Party is so requested or required to disclose any of the facts disclosure of which is prohibited under paragraph (3)(e) of this Agreement, the Receiving Party shall give the Furnishing Party prompt notice of such request so that the Furnishing Party may seek an appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, and, upon the Furnishing Party's request and at the Furnishing Party's expense, shall reasonably cooperate with the Furnishing Party in seeking such an order. If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by the Furnishing Party, the Receiving Party is nontheless, in the opinion of the Receiving Party's or (in the case of disclosure requested or required of a Representative, such Representative's) outside counsel or General Counsel, legally compelled to disclose Evaluation Material, the Receiving Party shall disclose only that portion of the Evaluation Material which the Receiving Party is legally required to disclose and upon the Furnishing Party's request and at the Furnishing Party's expense, shall use all requisite reasonable efforts to obtain assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded to such Evaluation Material to the extent such assurances are available. Subject to the foregoing conditions and limitations, the Receiving Party may disclose Evaluation Material under the circumstances set forth in this paragraph (b) without liability hereunder.\n (c) Other Public Disclosure. Except (i) for such public disclosure as may be necessary, in the good faith judgment of the disclosing Party consistent with advice of counsel, for the disclosing Party not to be in violation of any applicable law, regulation or order, or (ii) with the prior written consent of the order Party, neither Part shall:\n (x) make any disclosure (and each Party shall direct its Representatives not to make any disclosure) to any person of (A) the fact that discussions, negotiations or investigations are taking or have taken place concerning a Transaction, (B) the existence or contents of this Agreement, or the fact that either Party has requested or received Evaluation Material from the other Party, or (C) any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any proposed Transaction, including the status of the discussions or negotiations related thereto, or\n (y) make any public statement concerning a proposed Transaction.\n (d) Notice If either Party proposes to make any disclosure in reliance on clause (i) above, the disclosing Party shall, to the extent practicable, provide the other Party with the text of the proposed disclosure as far in advance of its disclosure as is practicable and shall in good faith consult with and consider the suggestions of the other Party concerning the nature and scope of the information it proposes to disclose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party may make such public announcement or public statement if in the opinion of such Party's outside counsel or General Counsel, such public announcement or public statement is necessary to avoid committing a violation of law or of any rule or regulation of any securities association, stock exchange or national securities quotation system on which such Party's securities are listed or trade. In such event, the disclosing Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to give advance notice to the other Party and to consult with the other Party on the timing and content of any such public announcement or public statement.\n (e) Certain Securities Law Restrictions. Each Party acknowledges that the Evaluation Material may contain material nonpublic information concerning the Furnishing Party. Each Party further acknowledges its awareness of the restrictions imposed by federal and state securities laws on persons in possession of material nonpublic information. Nothing herein shall constitute an admission by either Party that any Evaluation Material in fact contains material nonpublic information concerning the Furnishing Party.\n (f) Contact with Employees and Representatives. Neither Party shall communicate with any employee of the other Party regarding the Transaction or disclose any Evaluation Material to any employee or Representative of the other Party, other than the employees and Representatives named on the working group lists provided by the Parties from time to time.\n (g) General. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, neither Party will be restricted from using the information contained in the Evaluation Material that is retained in the minds of Representatives who have had access to the other Party's Evaluation Material, unless such use shall infringe on any of such Party's patent rights, trademark rights or copyright rights.\n 4. Accuracy of Evaluation Material: No Representations or Warranties. Each Party acknowledges and agrees (a) that no representation or warranty, express or implied, is made by either Party or any of its respective Representatives as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Material, and (b) that the Parties shall be entitled to rely only on those representations and warranties (if any) that may be made in a definitive written agreement for the Transaction, signed and delivered by both Parties, and then only to the extent, and subject to the limitations, provided therein.\n 5. No Solicitation.\n (a) For a period of one year subsequent to the termination of discussions regarding a Transaction, neither Party shall, without the prior written consent of the other Party, directly or indirectly solicit for hire any person currently employed by the other Party (or any of its subsidiaries) with whom the hiring Party first has contact, or who first becomes known to the hiring Party. In the course of the Parties' discussions and due diligence with respect to the proposed Transaction; provided, however, that the foregoing provision shall not prevent either Party, without such consent, from employing any employee who (i) contacts the hiring Party directly at his or her own initiative without any direct or indirect solicitation by or encouragement from the hiring Party, (ii) responds to a mass media solicitation or advertisement consistent with the hiring Party's past practices that is not directed at employees of the other Party or (iii) is identified by a third party executive search firm or employment agency without any assistance from such Party.\n (b) For a period one year from the date of this Agreement, neither Party shall, without the prior written consent of the other Party or the other Party's board of directors, either directly or indirectly through any affiliate or Representative or otherwise: (i) acquire, offer to acquire, or agree to acquire, by purchase, tender offer, merger, consolidation, share exchange or otherwise, ownership or control of any voting securities, or any direct or indirect right to acquire any voting securities, of the other Party, any subsidiary thereof, or any successor corporation thereto; (ii) make, or in any way participate in any \"solicitation\" of \"proxies\" (as such terms are used in the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission) to vote, or seek to advise or influence any person or entity with respect to the voting of, any voting securities of the other Party; (iii) seek or propose to influence or control the management or policies of the other Party; (iv) make any public announcement with respect to, or submit a proposal for, or offer of any merger, acquisition or other business combination or extraordinary transaction involving the other Party or any of its subsidiaries or any securities or assets of the other Party or any of its subsidiaries; (v) form, join or in any way participate in a \"group\"( as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) in connection with any of the foregoing, or (vi) request the other Party or any of the other party's Representatives to amend or waive any provision of this paragraph 5(b) in any manner which may reasonably be expected to compel or result in public disclosure; provided that such limitations shall expire upon the public announcement of a third party tender offer for more than fifty percent of the outstanding voting 3\nsecurities of the other Party or a business combination between the other Party and a third party. Each Party (the \"Representing Party\") represents and warrants to the other Party that as of the date of this Agreement the Representing Party does not directly or indirectly own or possess voting or dispositive control over any voting securities of the other Party.\n 6. Return and Destruction of Evaluation Material. At any time after termination of discussions by either Party with respect to the Transaction, upon the request of the Furnishing Party, the Receiving Party shall promptly (and in no event later than five business days after such request) (a) redeliver or cause to be redelivered to the Furnishing Party all copies of all Primary Evaluation Material in the possession or control of the Receiving Party or its Representatives which is in a visual or written format and erase or destroy all copies of all such Primary Evaluation Material which is stored in electronic format, and (b) destroy or cause to be destroyed all Derivative Evaluation Material in the possession or control of the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives. Nothing herein shall obligate the Receiving Party to provide any Derivative Evaluation Material to the Furnishing Party. Notwithstanding the return, destruction or erasure of Evaluation Material hereunder, the Receiving Party and its Representatives shall continue to be bound by their confidentiality and other obligations hereunder.\n 7. Remedies. Each Party agrees that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of any provision of this Agreement by it or any of its Representatives, and that in addition to all other remedies which either Party may have, each Party shall be entitled to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief as a remedy for any such breach. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Agreement but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity. No failure or delay by either Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder. In the event that either Party should institute proceedings to enforce any provision of this Agreement, the prevailing Party in such proceedings shall be entitled to recover all expenses relating to the enforcement of this Agreement, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, in addition to any other remedies.\n 8. Miscellaneous.\n (a) No License. Neither Party grants a license, by implication or otherwise, under any of its trade secrets or other intellectual property rights to the Receiving Party. The terms of this Agreement shall not be construed to limit either Party's right to independently develop or acquire products without use of the other Party's Evaluation Material. The Furnishing Party acknowledges that the Receiving Party may currently or in the future develop information internally, or receive information from other parties, that is similar to the Evaluation Material. Accordingly, nothing in this Agreement will be construed as a representation or agreement that the Receiving Party will not develop or have developed for its products, concepts, systems, or techniques that are similar to or compete with the products, concepts, systems or techniques contemplated by or embodied in the Evaluation Material, provided that the Receiving Party does not violate any of its obligations under this Agreement in connection with such development.\n (b) Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the sole and entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the confidentiality of the Evaluation Material and the confidentiality of their discussions, negotiations and investigations concerning a Transaction.\n (c) Amendment and Waiver. This Agreement may be amended, modified or waived only by a separate written instrument duly signed and delivered by or on behalf of both Parties.\n (d) Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not impair or affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement unless the enforcement of such provision in such circumstances would be inequitable.\n (e) No Obligation to Complete a Transaction. It is expressly understood that this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, constitute an agreement to consummate a Transaction, to conduct or continue negotiations with respect to a Transaction, or to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Transaction, and neither Party shall have any rights or obligations of any kind whatsoever with respect to such a Transaction by virtue of this Agreement or by virtue of any other written or oral expression by the Parties' respective Representatives unless and until a definitive agreement with respect to a Transaction is executed and delivered by both Parties, other than for the matters specifically agreed to herein. Both Parties further acknowledge and agree that each Party reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to provide or not to provide Evaluation Material to the Receiving Party under this Agreement, to reject any and all proposals made by the other Party or any of its Representatives with regard to a Transaction, and to terminate discussions and negotiations at any time. If either Party determines not to proceed with negotiations with respect to a Transaction, it will promptly inform the other Party of such determination.\n (f) Governing Law; Forum. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Georgia, without regard to the principles of the conflict of laws thereof. Each Party consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the State of Georgia, and the city of Atlanta, for the adjudication of any action, suit, or proceeding arising out of or otherwise relating to this Agreement.\n[Signatures on following page]\n The Parties have executed this Agreement as of the date first written above.\nEarthLink, Inc.

      "text": "Exhibit 99.8\nCONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT\nThis Confidentiality Agreement (this \u201cAgreement\u201d) is made and entered into as of October 17, 2016 by and between Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited, a Canadian corporation (\u201cFairfax\u201d), and Allied World Assurance Company Holdings, AG, a Swiss company (\u201cAllied World\u201d).\nWHEREAS, in order to evaluate a possible business combination or similar transaction (the \u201cPossible Transaction\u201d) between Fairfax (or one of its affiliates) and Allied World, each of Fairfax and Allied World may disclose and deliver to the other party (such first party, when disclosing such information, being the \u201cDisclosing Party\u201d and such other party, when receiving such information, being the \u201cReceiving Party\u201d) certain information about the Disclosing Party and/or its subsidiaries for the sole purpose of enabling the Receiving Party to evaluate, negotiate and consummate the Possible Transaction; and\nWHEREAS, as a condition to pursuing these discussions and exchanging information, the parties wish to enter into this Agreement to restrict the use and disclosure of such discussions and information and to provide for certain other matters;\nNOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, Fairfax and Allied World mutually agree as follows:\n1. Non-Disclosure Agreement.\n(a) All information that is furnished directly or indirectly by the Disclosing Party or any of its Representatives (as defined below), whether or not marked as confidential and whether furnished before or after the date hereof, whether in oral, written or electronic form, together with any notes, reports, summaries, analyses, compilations, forecasts, studies, interpretations, memoranda or other materials prepared by the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives that contain, references to or are based upon, in whole or in part, any information so furnished to the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives pursuant hereto (such notes, reports, summaries, analyses, compilations, forecasts, studies, interpretations, memoranda or other materials are referred to herein as \u201cDerivative Materials\u201d), is referred to herein as \u201cProprietary Information\u201d. Proprietary Information does not include, however, information that (i) was or becomes available to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Disclosing Party or any of its Representatives, which source the Receiving Party does not know, after reasonable inquiry, to be in violation of any legal duty or obligation owed to the Disclosing Party or any of its Representatives with respect to such information, (ii) was or becomes generally available to the public (other than as a result of a breach by the Receiving Party or its Representatives of this Agreement or a violation by the Receiving Party or its Representatives of any other non-use or confidentiality obligation), (iii) was previously in the possession of the Receiving Party, or (iv) was independently developed by the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives without reference to the\nProprietary Information. The term \u201cRepresentative\u201d means, as to any person, such person\u2019s affiliates, officers, directors, general partners, members, employees, consultants, investment bankers, financial advisors, accountants, legal counsel, consultants and potential lenders. The term \u201caffiliate\u201d has the meaning set forth in Rule 12b-2 of the regulations promulgated under Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d).\n(b) Except as otherwise permitted under this Agreement or as required by applicable law, regulation, stock exchange rule or by legal, judicial, regulatory or administrative process (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents in legal proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative demand or other similar process) (\u201cLegally Required\u201d), (a) the Receiving Party shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, keep all Proprietary Information confidential and not disclose or reveal any Proprietary Information to any person other than its Representatives who are participating in evaluating, negotiating, advising or financing with respect to the Possible Transaction or who otherwise need to know the Proprietary Information for the purpose of evaluating, negotiating, advising or financing with respect to the Possible Transaction (all of whom shall be informed of the confidential nature of such Proprietary Information) and shall cause its Representatives to treat such Proprietary Information in a confidential manner and in accordance with the terms hereof, provided that each party shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of its respective Representatives, (b) the Receiving Party shall not, and shall cause its Representatives not to, use any Proprietary Information for any purpose other than in connection with evaluating, negotiating, advising or financing with respect to the Possible Transaction or the consummation of the Possible Transaction, and (c) neither party shall, nor cause or permit their respective Representatives to, disclose to any person the existence or terms of this Agreement or that discussions or negotiations are taking or have taken place concerning the Possible Transaction, or any term, condition or other matter relating to the Possible Transaction (the information referred to in this clause (c), the \u201cTransaction Information\u201d). For the avoidance of doubt, each of those affiliates and Representatives of a Receiving Party that do not receive or have access to the Proprietary Information of the other party and the Transaction Information shall not be bound by or subject to the terms of this Agreement.\n2. Legally Required Disclosure; Return or Destruction of Proprietary Information. In the event the Receiving Party (or any of its Representatives) shall be Legally Required to disclose any Proprietary Information or Transaction Information, the Receiving Party shall, in advance of such disclosure, to the extent legally permissible, provide the Disclosing Party with notice of such requirement and a description of the Proprietary Information and Transaction Information that the Receiving Party or its Representative intends to disclose and to reasonably cooperate with the Disclosing Party to the extent it may seek to limit such disclosure, including, if requested, taking all reasonable steps, at the Disclosing Party\u2019s expense, to resist or avoid any such legal, judicial, regulatory or administrative process or to obtain a protective order in respect thereof. Upon either party\u2019s request, each party hereto shall (and shall cause its Representatives, and any other person, to whom it has disclosed any Proprietary Information or Transaction Information) promptly either (at the Receiving Party\u2019s option) return to the other party hereto or destroy (and certify in writing to the other party by an authorized officer supervising such destruction) all copies or other reproductions of Proprietary Information of the other party, other than any Derivative Materials, in its possession or the possession of any of its Representatives, and shall not retain any copies or other reproductions, in whole or in part, of such materials. The Receiving Party shall destroy all Derivative Materials, and such destruction will be certified in writing to the Disclosing Party by an authorized officer supervising such destruction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party may retain data or electronic records containing Proprietary Information or Derivative Materials for the purposes of complying with its record retention policies or as required by applicable law so long as such data or records are not accessible in the ordinary course of business. Notwithstanding the return or destruction of Proprietary Information required by this Paragraph 2, for the duration of the term of this Agreement, the Receiving Party and its Representatives shall continue to be bound by all duties and obligations hereunder in accordance with the terms hereof.\n3. Standstill. Each party hereby represents to the other party that, as of the date hereof, neither it nor any of its affiliates has beneficial ownership (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of any securities of the other party or any of its subsidiaries (other than securities owned by any benefit plan of such party). Each party further covenants and agrees, in consideration of it being furnished with Proprietary Information, that neither it nor any of its affiliates who have received or had access to the Proprietary Information of the other party (a \u201cRestricted Affiliate\u201d) will, at any time commencing on the date hereof and ending on the earliest of (a) the twelve (12) month anniversary of this Agreement, (b) the execution and delivery by Fairfax (or its affiliate(s)) and Allied World of a definitive agreement to effect the Possible Transaction and (c) a Fundamental Change Event (as defined below) with respect to the other party, directly or indirectly, unless requested in writing (or by email) by the other party\u2019s chief executive officer, chairman or board of directors: (i) acquire (or agree, offer, seek or propose to acquire, in each case, publicly or privately), by purchase, tender offer, exchange offer, agreement or business amalgamation or combination or in any other manner, any ownership, including beneficial ownership, as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, of any material assets or businesses or any securities of the other party or any of its subsidiaries, or any rights or options to acquire such ownership (including from any third party); (ii) publicly or privately offer to enter into, or publicly or privately propose, any merger, business combination, amalgamation, recapitalization, restructuring or other extraordinary transaction with the other party or any of its subsidiaries; (iii) initiate any stockholder proposal or the convening of a stockholders\u2019 meeting of or involving the other party or any of its subsidiaries; (iv) solicit proxies (as such terms are defined in Rule 14a-1 under the Exchange Act) or consents to vote with respect to any matter from, or otherwise seek to influence, advise or direct the vote of, holders of any shares of capital stock of the other party or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such capital stock; (v) otherwise seek or propose to influence, advise, change or control the management, board of directors, governing instruments, affairs or policies of the other party or any of its subsidiaries; (vi) make any public disclosure, or take any action that could reasonably be expected to require the other party to make a public disclosure, with respect to any of the matters set forth in this Agreement or (vii) assist, advise, act in concert or participate with or encourage others to, including as part of a \u201cgroup\u201d within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act, any of the foregoing; provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit a party from making a non-public proposal to the other party with respect to any transaction of the type described in clause (ii) of this Paragraph 3, so long as such proposal is not knowingly made by such party in a manner that would require the public disclosure thereof by either party. A \u201cFundamental Change Event\u201d means a party has after the date of this Agreement entered into a definitive written agreement with a third party providing for (i) any acquisition of a majority of the voting securities of such party by any person or group, (ii) any acquisition of a majority of the consolidated assets of such party and its subsidiaries by any person or group, or (iii) any tender or exchange offer, merger or other business combination, amalgamation or any recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation, dissolution or other extraordinary transaction (provided that, in the case of any transaction covered by the foregoing clause (iii), immediately following such transaction, any person (or the direct or indirect shareholders of such person) will beneficially own a majority of the outstanding voting power of such party or the surviving parent entity in such transaction).\n4. Non-Solicit. In consideration of being furnished the Proprietary Information by the other party, each party agrees that, for a period of twelve (12) months from the date of this Agreement, such party and its Restricted Affiliates shall not employ or solicit to employ any of the current officers or employees of the other party or its subsidiaries with whom such party or its Representatives has had contact in connection with the evaluation of the Possible Transaction or who were specifically identified to such party during the period of investigation of the other party pursuant to this Agreement, without obtaining the prior written consent of the other party. The use of an independent employment agency or employee search firm (so long as it is not directed by such party to solicit employees of the other party or its subsidiaries) or newspaper, trade publication or online job advertising and the hiring as a result thereof of any employee shall not be construed as a breach of this Agreement.\n5. Term. This Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force and effect on the earlier of (a) one (1) year from the date hereof and (b) the execution and delivery by Fairfax and Allied World of a definitive agreement to effect the Possible Transaction.\n6. Miscellaneous. This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of New York and will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. This Agreement may be amended or modified only in a written instrument executed by the parties hereto. It is understood and agreed that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement and that each party shall be entitled to specific performance as a remedy for any such breach or threatened breach of this Agreement. This remedy shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedy for any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity. The parties hereto agree that unless and until a definitive agreement is executed and delivered with respect to the Possible Transaction, neither party intends to be, nor shall either be, under any legal obligation with respect to the Possible Transaction or otherwise, by virtue of any written or oral expressions by themselves or their respective Representatives with respect to the Possible Transaction, including any obligation to commence or continue discussions or negotiations, except for the matters specifically agreed to in this Agreement. Neither party hereto makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, on which the other party may rely as to the accuracy or completeness of the Proprietary Information and only those representations and warranties made in writing in a definitive agreement for a Possible Transaction, if any, shall have any legal effect. The parties hereto also agree that, other than as may be set forth in a definitive agreement for a Possible Transaction, neither party hereto shall have any liability whatsoever to the other party, including in contract, tort or under federal or state securities laws, arising out of, relating to, or resulting from, any errors or omissions in the Proprietary Information. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts which may be delivered by way of PDF or similar electronic facsimile, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which shall constitute one and the same Agreement.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have duly executed this Agreement as of the date first above written.\nFAIRFAX FINANCIAL HOLDINGS LIMITED\nBy: /s/ Paul Rivett\nName: Paul Rivett\nTitle: President\nALLIED WORLD ASSURANCE COMPANY HOLDINGS, AG\nBy: /s/ Wesley D.

The Parties desire to exchange certain proprietary or confidential information for the purpose of evaluating the potential acquisition of certain of Calpine\u2019s power generating facilities and other assets (the \u201cProposed Transaction\u201d); and\nB. The Parties are willing to provide such information for such purpose in accordance with the terms hereof; NOW, THEREFORE, Calpine and LS Power do hereby mutually agree as follows:\n1. Definitions.\na. \"Confidential Information\" shall mean all confidential or proprietary written, recorded, electronic or oral information or data (including without limitation research, developmental, engineering, manufacturing, technical, marketing, sales, financial, operating, performance, cost, business and process information or data, trade secrets, discoveries, ideas, designs, data, source code, object code, processes, computer programs, developments, flow diagrams, know-how, and computer programming and other software and software techniques) provided (whether such confidentiality or proprietary status is indicated orally or in writing, whether or not the specific words \"confidential\" or \"proprietary\" are used) to a Party (the \u201cReceiving Party\u201d) by the other Party (the \u201cDisclosing Party\u201d) in the course of the exchange of such information or data between the Parties. Without limiting the aforesaid, the existence of discussions between the Parties regarding the Proposed Transaction shall constitute Confidential Information hereunder.\nb. \u201cPerson\u201d shall be broadly interpreted to include, without limitation, any corporation, company, partnership, other entity or individual.\nc. \u201cRepresentatives\u201d shall mean as to any Person, its directors, officers, employees, agents and advisors (including, without limitation, financial advisors, attorneys and accountants).\n2. Confidentiality and Non-Use. In consideration of each Party's providing Confidential Information, the Parties agree as follows:\na. The Receiving Party shall hold confidential and not disclose to any Person, without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party, all Confidential Information and any information about the Proposed Transaction, or the terms or conditions or any other facts relating thereto, including, without limitation, the fact that discussions are taking place with respect thereto or the status thereof, or the fact that Confidential Information has been made available to the Receiving Party or its Representatives; provided, however, that the Receiving Party may disclose such Confidential Information to its Representatives who are actively and directly participating in its evaluation of the Proposed Transaction or who otherwise need to know the Confidential Information for the purpose of evaluating the Proposed Transaction;\nb. The Receiving Party shall cause all its Representatives to observe the terms of this Agreement and shall be responsible for any breach of the terms of this Agreement by it or its Representatives; and\nc. The Receiving Party shall return or destroy all Confidential Information (including all copies thereof) within thirty (30) days of receipt of a written request.\nIn addition to the foregoing, the Receiving Party will not use the Confidential Information (a) in any way detrimental to the Disclosing Party\u2019s shareholders or (b) for any purpose other than in connection with the Proposed Transaction between the Parties.\n3. Exceptions to the Confidentiality and Non-Use Obligations. The obligations imposed by Section 2 hereof shall not apply, or shall cease to apply, to any Confidential Information if or when, but only to the extent that, such Confidential Information:\na. was known to the Receiving Party prior to the receipt of the Confidential Information; or\nb. was, or becomes through no breach of the Receiving Party's obligations hereunder, known to the public; or\nc. becomes known to the Receiving Party from sources other than the Disclosing Party under circumstances not involving any breach of any confidentiality obligation; or\nd. is independently developed by the Receiving Party, as evidenced by the written records thereof.\nIt shall not be a breach of the confidentiality obligations hereof for a Receiving Party to disclose Confidential Information where, but only to the extent that, such disclosure is required by law or applicable legal process, provided in such case the Receiving Party shall (i) give the earliest notice possible to the Disclosing Party that such disclosure is or may be required and (ii) reasonably cooperate in protecting such confidential or proprietary nature of the Confidential Information which must so be disclosed.\n4. No Further Agreements Hereunder. Neither Calpine nor LS Power or any parent, subsidiary or affiliate thereof, shall be under any obligation to enter into any further agreements with the other signatory hereto or its parents, subsidiaries or affiliates of any nature whatsoever as a result of this Agreement. The Parties shall be free at all times to hold negotiations or enter into agreements with any other persons whatsoever (including with respect to projects under discussion by the Parties hereto) in addition to or in lieu of the discussions hereunder and any such activities shall not be a breach of this agreement or any obligations owed to the other Party hereunder. Each Party hereto reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to decline, to retract or to reject at any time any proposal which has not yet become legally binding by execution of a written agreement between the Parties with respect thereto, or with respect to any further agreements or business arrangements with the other Party hereto, its parents, subsidiaries or affiliates and to terminate all further discussions and negotiations.\n5. No Representations and Warranties. Each of the Parties make no representation or warranties, express or implied, of any kind to the other Party with respect to the Confidential Information, including without limitation with respect to the accuracy or completeness thereof. Any representations or warranties shall be made thereby, if at all, only in definitive written agreements that may be entered into hereafter.\n6. Termination; Duration of Obligations. Unless sooner terminated by mutual written Agreement of the Parties hereto, this Agreement and the obligations hereunder shall terminate one (1) year from the date hereof.\n7. Entire Agreement. This Agreement represents the entire understanding and agreement of the Parties and supersedes all prior communications, agreements and understandings between the Parties relating to the subject matter hereof.\n8. Waivers; Amendments; Assignment; Counterparts. This Agreement may not be modified, amended or waived except by a written instrument duly executed by both Parties. No failure or delay by either Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder. This Agreement may not be assigned by either Party without the prior written consent of the other and shall be binding on, and inure to the benefit of, the respective successors of the Parties thereto. This Agreement may be signed in two or more counterpart originals, each of which shall constitute an original document. The Parties agree that this Agreement can be executed via facsimile signatures and be binding.\n9. Governing Law; Disputes. This Agreement is made subject to and shall be construed under the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to its principles or rules regarding conflicts of laws, and that the state and federal courts situated in the State of New York shall have exclusive jurisdiction to resolve any disputes with respect to this Agreement or the Confidential Information with each Party irrevocably consenting to the jurisdiction thereof for any actions, suits or proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Confidential Information, and each Party irrevocably waives its rights to jury trials with respect thereto.\n10. Remedies. Without prejudice to the rights and remedies otherwise available to either Party, each Party shall be entitled to equitable relief by way of injunction or otherwise if the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives breach or threaten to breach any of the provisions of this Agreement and the Receiving Party shall not plead in defense thereto that there would be an adequate remedy at law.\n11. Non-Publicity: All media releases, public announcements and other disclosures by either Party relating to this Agreement or the subject matter hereof, including promotional or marketing material, but excluding announcements intended solely for internal distribution or to meet legal or regulatory requirements, shall be coordinated with and approved by the other Party prior to release. In addition, the Receiving Party shall refrain from removing, overprinting or defacing any notices of copyright, trademark, logo or other proprietary identifications or notices of confidentiality, from any originals or copies of the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the Parties has caused this Agreement to be executed by their respective, fully authorized representatives as of the date first written above.\nCalpine Corporation LS Power Equity Advisors, LLC\nBy: /s/ W.

      "text": "Exhibit (d)(2)\nMUTUAL NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nThis Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement (this \u201cAgreement\u201d) by and between Jamba, Inc., a Delaware corporation, including on behalf of its affiliates (the \u201cCompany\u201d), and FOCUS Brands Inc., a Delaware corporation, including on behalf of its subsidiaries (the \u201cParticipant\u201d and together with the Company, each a \u201cParty\u201d and collectively, the \u201cParties\u201d), is dated as of the latest date set forth on the signature page hereto (the \u201cEffective Date\u201d).\n1. General. In connection with the consideration of a possible negotiated transaction (a \u201cPossible Transaction\u201d) between the Parties, each Party (in its capacity as a provider of information hereunder, a \u201cProvider\u201d) is prepared to make available to the other Party (in its capacity as a recipient of information hereunder, a \u201cRecipient\u201d) certain Evaluation Material (as defined in Section 2 below) in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, and hereby agrees to take or abstain from taking certain other actions as hereinafter set forth.\n2. Definitions.\n(a) The term \u201caffiliates\u201d shall mean, with respect to any Person, any other Person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with such Person.\n(b) The term \u201cBeneficial Ownership\u201d when used with reference to a security shall have the meaning ascribed to it under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201c1934 Act\u201d), except that for purposes of this definition, the term security shall include any option, warrant, or convertible security regardless of exercise or conversion date, and also include any stock appreciation right, or similar right with an exercise or conversion privilege or a settlement payment or mechanism at a price related to the security or with a value derived in whole or in part from the value of the security, whether or not such instrument or right shall be subject to settlement in securities or otherwise and any other direct or indirect opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any increase or decrease in the value of the security.\n(c) The term \u201cEvaluation Material\u201d means information (whether oral, written, electronic or otherwise) concerning Provider which has been or is furnished to Recipient or its Representatives (as defined below) by or on behalf of Provider in connection with Recipient\u2019s evaluation of a Possible Transaction, including Provider\u2019s business, financial condition, operations, assets, liabilities, personnel and contracts, and includes all notes, analyses, compilations, studies, interpretations or other documents prepared by Recipient or its Representatives which contain or are based upon, in whole or in part, the information furnished by the Provider hereunder. The term Evaluation Material does not include information which (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by Recipient or any of its Representatives in breach of this Agreement, (ii) was within a Recipient\u2019s or its Representatives\u2019 (on behalf of Recipient) possession, prior to its being furnished to Recipient or its Representatives by or on behalf of Provider or (iii) is or becomes available to Recipient or its Representatives (on behalf of Recipient) from a source other than the Provider or its Representatives, provided that the source of such information was not bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to, Provider with respect to such information or (iv) Recipient can reasonably show was independently developed by Recipient or Recipient\u2019s Representatives without the use of or reference to any Evaluation Material provided by or on behalf of Provider or its Representatives.\n(d) The term \u201cRepresentatives\u201d shall include the directors, officers, employees, potential financing sources, partners, agents and advisors (including, without limitation, attorneys, accountants, consultants, bankers and financial advisors) of a Party who have a need to know the Evaluation Material for purposes of evaluating a Possible Transaction, but only those of the foregoing who actually receive Evaluation Material directly from or at the direction of such Party. For the avoidance of doubt, Roark Capital Acquisition LLC shall be a Representative of FOCUS Brands Inc. under this Agreement.\n(e) The term \u201cPerson\u201d includes the media and any corporation, partnership, group, individual or other entity.\n3. Use of Evaluation Material. Each Recipient shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, (i) use the Evaluation Material solely for the purpose of evaluating a Possible Transaction and (ii) keep the Evaluation Material confidential, and, subject to Section 5, will not, and will cause its Representatives not to, disclose any of the Evaluation Material in any manner whatsoever; provided, however, that any of such information may be disclosed to Recipient\u2019s Representatives who need to know such information for the sole purpose of helping Recipient evaluate a Possible Transaction. Each Recipient agrees to be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of such Recipient\u2019s Representatives.\nThis Agreement does not grant Recipient or any of its Representatives any license to use Provider\u2019s Evaluation Material except as provided herein. In addition, all proprietary and intellectual property rights in and to the Evaluation Material shall remain the sole property of Provider, and nothing in this Agreement shall be construed in any way to grant to Recipient or its Representatives or any other Person any express or implied option, license or other right, title or interest in or to any Evaluation Material, or to any intellectual property rights embodied in such Evaluation Material.\n4. Non-Disclosure of Discussions. Subject to Section 5, each Party agrees that, without the prior written consent of the other Party, such Party will not, and will cause its Representative not to, disclose to any other Person (i) that Evaluation Material has been exchanged between the Parties, (ii) that discussions or negotiations are taking place between the Parties concerning a Possible Transaction or any other transaction between the Parties or (iii) any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect thereto (including the status thereof) ; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall be deemed to inhibit, impair or restrict the ability of Recipient or its Representatives from having discussions or negotiations with other persons relating to potential financing in connection with the Possible Transaction so long as each of such Persons agrees in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement applicable to Representatives.\n5. Legally Required Disclosure. If a Recipient or its Representatives are requested or required (by oral questions, interrogatories, other requests for information or documents in legal proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative demand or other similar process) to disclose any of the Evaluation Material or any of the facts disclosure of which is prohibited under Section 4 above, such Recipient shall provide Provider with prompt written notice of any such request or requirement together with copies of the material proposed to be disclosed so that Provider may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by Provider, a Recipient or any of its Representatives is nonetheless legally compelled or required to disclose Evaluation Material or any of the facts disclosure of which is prohibited under Section 4 or would be liable for contempt or suffer other censure or penalty, such Recipient or its respective Representatives may, without liability hereunder, disclose to such requiring Person only that portion of such Evaluation Material or any such facts which Recipient or its Representatives is legally compelled or required to disclose, provided that Recipient and/or its Representatives cooperate with Provider to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Evaluation Material or such facts by the Person receiving the material. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither Recipient nor Recipient\u2019s Representatives shall be required to provide notice or seek consent to disclose any information in connection with a routine audit by, or blanket request from, a regulatory or governmental entity with jurisdiction over Recipient or Recipient\u2019s Representatives, and not directed at the Company or the Possible Transaction; provided that the Recipient or its Representatives, as applicable, inform any such authority of the confidential nature of the information disclosed to them and to keep such information confidential in accordance with such authority\u2019s policies or procedures.\n6. \u201cClick Through\u201d Agreements. The terms of this Agreement shall control over any additional purported confidentiality requirements imposed by an offering memorandum or electronic database, dataroom, or similar repository of Evaluation Material to which Recipient or its Representatives are granted access in connection with this Agreement or a Possible Transaction, notwithstanding acceptance of such an offering memorandum or submission of an electronic signature, \u201cclicking\u201d on an \u201cI Agree\u201d icon or other indication of assent to such additional confidentiality conditions, it being understood and agreed that Recipient\u2019s and its Representatives\u2019 confidentiality obligations with respect to the Evaluation Material are exclusively governed by this Agreement and may not be reduced or enlarged except by an agreement executed by the Parties hereto in traditional written format.\n7. Return or Destruction of Evaluation Material. At any time upon the request of a Provider for any reason, a Recipient will, and will direct its Representatives to, promptly, but not later than 10 business days, after receipt of such notice or request, destroy or return (at Recipient\u2019s option) all Evaluation Material and all documents that incorporate Evaluation Material, and no copy or extract thereof (including electronic copies) shall be retained, except that Recipient and its Representatives may retain one copy to be kept confidential and used solely for archival, legal, and compliance purposes. Recipient shall provide to the Provider written confirmation of destruction signed by an authorized representative of Recipient. Notwithstanding the return or destruction of the Evaluation Material, Recipient and its Representatives will continue to be bound by such Recipient\u2019s obligations hereunder with respect to such Evaluation Material.\n8. No Solicitation. Recipient will not, within eighteen months from the date of this Agreement, directly or indirectly solicit the employment or consulting services of or employ or engage as a consultant any of the senior or key employees of the Provider or any of its subsidiaries nor any other employee of the Provider or any if its subsidiaries with whom Recipient has had direct contact in connection with its evaluation of a Possible Transaction or of whom it has become aware as a result of its receipt of any Evaluation Material, so long as they are employed by the Provider or any of its subsidiaries and for two months thereafter. For the purposes of clarification, the mere receipt of Provider\u2019s employee list by Recipient shall not be considered a solicitation of or a direct contact with such employees pursuant to this section. A Recipient is not prohibited from: (i) soliciting by means of a general advertisement not directed at any particular individual or the employees of the Provider or its subsidiaries generally or (ii) engaging any recruiting firm or similar organization to identify or solicit individuals for employment on behalf of such Recipient (and soliciting any person identified by any such recruiting firm or organization) so long as such Recipient does not identify either Provider or any of the individuals employed by Provider to be solicited by such recruiting firm or organization. The provisions of this Section 8 shall terminate and be of no further effect upon the acquisition of such Provider by a third party.\n9. Standstill. Participant does not own any of the capital stock of the Company as of the Effective Date. Participant agrees that, for a period of one year after the date of this Agreement (the \u201cStandstill Period\u201d), unless specifically invited in writing by the Company, neither it nor (1) any of its majority-owned subsidiaries, (2) its Representatives (acting on its behalf), or (3) Roark Capital Acquisition LLC or its affiliates who receive Evaluation Material directly from Roark Capital Acquisition LLC or Participant or at their direction, will in any manner, directly or indirectly:\n(a) effect, seek, offer or propose (whether publicly or otherwise) to effect, or cause or participate in, or in any way assist any other Person to effect, seek, offer or propose (whether publicly or otherwise) to effect or participate in:\n(i) any acquisition of any securities (or any acquisition of Beneficial Ownership thereof) or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries,\n(ii) any tender or exchange offer, merger or other business combination involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries,\n(iii) any recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation, dissolution or other extraordinary transaction with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or\n(iv) any \u201csolicitation\u201d of \u201cproxies\u201d (as such terms are used in the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission) or consents to vote any voting securities of the Company;\n(b) form, join or in any way participate in a \u201cgroup\u201d (as defined under the Act) with respect to the securities of the Company;\n(c) make any public announcement with respect to, or submit an unsolicited proposal for or offer of (with or without condition), any extraordinary transaction involving the Company or its securities or assets;\n(d) otherwise act, alone or in concert with others, to seek to control or influence the management, Board of Directors or policies of the Company;\n(e) take any action which may reasonably be expected to force the Company to make a public announcement regarding any of the types of matters set forth in (a) above; or\n(f) enter into any discussions or arrangements with any third party with respect to any of the foregoing.\nParticipant also agrees, and will cause its Representatives to agree, during the Standstill Period, not to request the Company (or its directors, officers, employees or agents), directly or indirectly, to amend or waive any provision of this Section 9 (including this sentence).\nNotwithstanding anything in this Section 9 to the contrary, if, at any time during the Standstill Period, a public announcement is made by the Company or any other Person (other than Participant or its Representatives) that a third party (other than Participant or its Representatives) intends to acquire at least twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding capital stock of the Company, voting control or a material part of the Company\u2019s assets (by way of a tender offer, exchange offer, proxy contest, acquisition or other similar transaction), or if a definitive agreement is executed by the Company with a third party relating to such an acquisition of capital stock or assets, the restrictions set forth in this Section 9 shall immediately terminate and cease to be of any further effect on Participant.\nParticipant further agrees, and will cause its Representatives to agree, that unless otherwise directed by the Company in writing (i) all communications with the Company regarding a Possible Transaction, (ii) requests for additional information, facility tours, or management meetings, and (iii) discussions or questions regarding procedures with respect to a Possible Transaction, will be submitted or directed by Participant or its Representatives only to David Pace, the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, or a person or persons designated in writing by David Pace. Further, except upon the Company\u2019s prior written consent, neither Participant nor its Representatives acting on behalf of Participant involved with a Possible Transaction or who have received Evaluation Material will, directly or indirectly, contact any stockholder, director, officer, employee or agent of the Company, or any customer or supplier of the Company, regarding the Evaluation Material or a Possible Transaction. Nothing contained herein shall prevent Participant or its Representatives from maintaining any contacts in the ordinary course of business unrelated to a Possible Transaction or from conducting consumer surveys or other due diligence, in each case, without disclosing or relying on any Evaluation Material.\n10. Maintaining Privileges. If any Evaluation Material includes materials or information subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or threatened legal proceedings or governmental investigations, each Party understands and agrees that the Parties have a commonality of interest with respect to such matters and it is the desire, intention and mutual understanding of the Parties that the sharing of such material is not intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or its continued protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege. All Evaluation Material that is entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege shall remain entitled to such protection under these privileges, this Agreement, and under the joint defense doctrine.\n11. Compliance with Securities Laws. Each Recipient acknowledges that the Evaluation Material may include material nonpublic information (within the meaning of the securities laws of the United States) with respect to Provider. Each Recipient agrees not to use and will cause its Representatives to agree not to use any Evaluation Material of Provider in violation of applicable securities laws.\n12. Not a Transaction Agreement. Each Party understands and agrees that no contract or agreement providing for a Possible Transaction exists between the Parties unless and until a final definitive agreement for a Possible Transaction has been executed and delivered, and each Party hereby waives, in advance, any claims (including, without limitation, breach of contract) relating to the existence of a Possible Transaction unless and until both Parties shall have entered into a final definitive agreement for a Possible Transaction. Each Party also agrees that, unless and until a final definitive agreement regarding a Possible Transaction has been executed and delivered, neither Party will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to such Possible Transaction by virtue of this Agreement except for the matters specifically agreed to herein. Neither Party is under any obligation to accept any proposal regarding a Possible Transaction and either Party may terminate discussions and negotiations with the other Party at any time.\n13. No Representations or Warranties; No Obligation to Disclose. Each Recipient understands and acknowledges that neither Provider nor its Representatives makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Material furnished by or on behalf of Provider and shall have no liability to Recipient, its Representatives or any other Person relating to or resulting from the use of the Evaluation Material furnished to a Recipient or its respective Representatives or any errors therein or omissions therefrom. As to the information delivered to Recipient, Provider will only be liable for those representations or warranties which are made in a final definitive agreement regarding a Possible Transaction, when, as and if executed, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be specified therein. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as obligating Provider to provide, or to continue to provide, any information to any Person.\n14. Modifications and Waiver. No provision of this Agreement can be waived or amended in favor of either Party except by written consent of the other Party, which consent shall specifically refer to such provision and explicitly make such waiver or amendment. No failure or delay by either Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder.\n15. Remedies. Each Party understands and agrees that money damages may not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by either Party or any of its Representatives and that the Party against which such breach is committed shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, as a remedy for any such breach or threat thereof. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach by either Party of this Agreement, but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity to the Party against which such breach is committed.\n16. Legal Fees. In the event of litigation relating to this Agreement, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that either Party or its Representatives has breached this Agreement, then the Party which is, or the Party whose Representatives are, determined to have so breached shall be liable and pay to the other Party the reasonable legal fees and costs incurred by the other Party in connection with such litigation, including any appeal therefrom.\n17. Governing Law. This Agreement is for the benefit of each Party and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements made and to be performed entirely within such state.\n18. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction contained in this Agreement is held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants or restrictions contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and if a covenant or provision is determined to be unenforceable by reason of its extent, duration, scope or otherwise, then the Parties intend and hereby request that the court or other authority making that determination shall only modify such extent, duration, scope or other provision to the extent necessary to make it enforceable and enforce them in their modified form for all purposes of this Agreement.\n19. Construction. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring either Party by virtue of the authorship at any of the provisions of this Agreement.\n20. Term. This Agreement, and all obligations and other provisions hereunder, shall terminate two years after the date of this Agreement.\n21. Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the Parties regarding the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, arrangements and discussions between the Parties regarding such subject matter.\n22. Counterparts. This Agreement may be signed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall be deemed to constitute a single instrument.\n23. Consent to Representation. This agreement also constitutes notice to Participant that the Company has engaged DLA Piper LLP (US) and its affiliated firms as its legal counsel in connection with the Possible Transaction, and Participant hereby (i) consents to the continued representation of the Company by DLA Piper LLP (US) and its affiliated firms in relation to the Possible Transaction notwithstanding the fact that DLA Piper LLP (US) may have represented, and may currently or in the future represent, Participant and/or any of its respective affiliates with respect to unrelated matters and (ii) waive any actual or alleged conflict and actual or alleged violation of ethical or comparable rules applicable to DLA Piper LLP (US) and its affiliated firms that may arise from its representation of the Company in connection with the Possible Transaction, including but not limited to representing the Company against Participant and/or its affiliates in litigation, arbitration, or mediation in connection therewith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any dispute (including litigation, arbitration, or mediation) between the Parties related to this Agreement, DLA Piper LLP (US) and its affiliated firms will not represent either Party. In addition, Participant hereby acknowledges that the consent and waiver under this paragraph is voluntary and informed, and that Participant has obtained independent legal advice with respect to this consent and waiver. Participant further agrees that they are each aware of the extent of their respective relationships, if any, with DLA Piper LLP (US) and its affiliate firms, and do not require additional information from DLA Piper LLP (US) in order to understand the nature of this consent. Each of DLA Piper LLP (US) and its affiliated firms are an express third party beneficiary of this paragraph.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the undersigned entities has caused this Agreement to be signed by its duly authorized representative as of the date written below.\nJAMBA, INC.

      "text": "Exhibit (d)(2)\nMUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nThis Non-Disclosure Agreement (\u201cAgreement\u201d) is effective as of October 20, 2011 (\u201cEffective Date\u201d) and is entered into between SuccessFactors, Inc., a Delaware corporation, having a place of business at 1500 Fashion Island Boulevard, San Mateo, California, 94404, USA (\u201cCompany\u201d), and SAP AG, a German company with its place of business at Dietmar Hopp Allee 16, 69190 Walldorf, Germany on behalf of itself and its wholly owned subsidiaries, (\u201cSAP\u201d). In consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein, SAP and Company, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree to the following:\n1. In connection with an evaluation relating to a potential relationship, cooperation or transaction (the \u201cEvaluation\u201d), SAP and Company may deliver to each other, upon the execution of this Agreement, Confidential Information as defined below (the party disclosing such Confidential Information being the \u201cDisclosing Party\u201d and the party receiving such Confidential Information being the \u201cReceiving Party\u201d).\n2. As used herein, \u201cConfidential Information\u201d shall mean all information furnished by the Disclosing Party or its Representatives (defined below) to the Receiving Party or its Representatives, whether orally, in writing, electronically or in other tangible form, and identified as confidential or proprietary at the time of disclosure by the Disclosing Party or otherwise disclosed in a manner such that a reasonable person would understand its confidential nature, including but not limited to, information that is related to: (a) the business plans or operations of the Disclosing Party; (b) the research and development or investigations of the Disclosing Party; (c) the business of any customer or partner of the Disclosing Party; (d) Disclosing Party\u2019s properties, employees, finances, operations; (e) any information about or concerning any third party (which information was provided to the Disclosing Party subject to an applicable confidentiality obligation to such third party); (f) software and related documentation (\u201cDisclosing Party\u2019s Software\u201d) including the following information regarding Disclosing Party\u2019s Software: (i) computer software (object and source codes), programming techniques and programming concepts, methods of processing, system designs embodied in Disclosing Party\u2019s Software; and (ii) discoveries, inventions, concepts, designs, flow charts, documentation, product specifications, application program interface specifications, techniques and processes relating to Disclosing Party\u2019s Software; and (g) product offerings, content partners, product pricing, product availability, technical drawings, algorithms, processes, ideas, techniques, formulas, data, schematics, trade secrets, know-how, improvements, inventions (whether patentable or not), marketing plans, forecasts and strategies. Where the Confidential Information has not been reduced to written or other tangible form at the time of disclosure, and such disclosure is made orally or visually, the Disclosing Party agrees to identify it as confidential or proprietary at the time of disclosure. \u201cConfidential Information\u201d shall be deemed to include all notes, analyses, compilations, studies, interpretations or other documents prepared by the Receiving Party or its Representatives which contain or are based upon, in whole or in part, the information furnished to the receiving party or its Representatives pursuant hereto.\n3. Confidential Information shall not be reproduced in any form except as required to accomplish the intent of this Agreement. Any reproduction of any Confidential Information of a Disclosing Party shall remain the property of the Disclosing Party and shall contain any and all confidential or proprietary notices or legends which appear on the original. The Receiving Party:\n(a) shall take all reasonable steps (defined below) to keep all Confidential Information strictly confidential; (b) shall not disclose or reveal any Confidential Information to any person other than its Representatives who are actively and directly participating in the Evaluation or who otherwise need to know the Confidential Information for the purpose of the Evaluation; (c) shall not use Confidential Information for any purpose other than in connection with the Evaluation. and (d) shall not disclose to any person (other than those of its Representatives who are actively and directly participating in the Evaluation or who otherwise need to know for the purpose of the Evaluation) any information about the Evaluation, or the terms or conditions or any other facts relating thereto, including, without limitation, the fact that discussions are taking place with respect thereto or the status thereof, or the fact that Confidential Information has been made available to the Receiving Party or its Representatives. As used herein \u201creasonable steps\u201d means those steps the Receiving Party takes to protect its own similar proprietary and confidential information, which shall not be less than a reasonable standard of care. As used herein. \u201cRepresentatives\u201d shall mean (i) employees of Receiving Party; (ii) attorneys, accountants, or other professional business advisors and, additionally,\n(iii) employees of the Receiving Party and those entities directly or indirectly owned by the Receiving Party, in each case, who shall be informed of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information and shall agree to act in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Receiving Party shall be responsible for any breach of the terms of this Agreement by it or its Representatives.\n4. The above restrictions on the use or disclosure of the Confidential Information shall not apply to any Confidential Information that: (a) is independently developed by Receiving Party without reference to the Confidential Information, or is lawfully received free of restriction from a third party having the right to furnish such Confidential Information; (b) has become generally available to the public without breach of this Agreement by Receiving Party; (c) at the time of disclosure to Receiving Party was known to such party free of restriction; or (d) Disclosing Party agrees in writing is free of such restrictions.\n5. Neither party is required to disclose any particular information to the other and any disclosure is entirely voluntary and is not intended to be construed as: (a) granting rights by license or otherwise under any trademark, patent, copyright or other intellectual property right; (b) creating a commitment as to any product, including the development or functionality of any product; (c) soliciting any business or incurring any obligation not specified herein; or (d) prohibiting either party from associating themselves with competitors of the other party for purposes substantially similar to those involved herein.\n6. Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict either party\u2019s right to develop, make, use, market, license or distribute products or services similar to or competitive with those of the other party disclosed in the Confidential Information as long as it shall not thereby breach this Agreement. Each party acknowledges that the other may already possess or have developed products or services similar to or competitive with those of the other party disclosed in the Confidential Information. Further, either party shall be free to use for any purpose the residuals (defined below) resulting from access to or work with Confidential Information disclosed hereunder. The term \u201cresiduals\u201d means information in non-tangible form which may be retained in the unaided memory by persons who have had access to the Confidential Information so long as such persons have not studied the information for the purpose of replicating the same from memory. Neither party shall have any obligation to limit or restrict the assignment of such persons or to pay royalties for any work resulting from the use of residuals. The party using any information that it claims to be residuals will have the burden of proving that the information constitutes residuals.\n7. In the event that the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives are requested pursuant to, or required by, applicable law or regulation or by legal process to disclose any Confidential Information or any other information concerning the Disclosing Party or the Evaluation, unless prohibited by law, the Receiving Party shall provide the Disclosing Party with prompt notice of such request or requirement in order to enable the Disclosing Party (i) to seek an appropriate protective order or other remedy; (ii) to consult with the Receiving Party with respect to the Disclosing Party\u2019s taking steps to resist or narrow the scope of such request or legal process; or (iii) to waive compliance, in whole or in part, with the terms of this Agreement. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained in a timely manner, or the Disclosing Party waives compliance, in whole or in part, with the terms of this Agreement, the Receiving Party or its Representative shall disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information which is legally required to be disclosed and to require that all Confidential Information that is so disclosed will be accorded confidential treatment.\n8. To the extent that any Confidential Information may Include material subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or threatened legal proceedings or governmental investigations, the parties understand and agree that they have a commonality of interest with respect to such matters and it is their desire, intention and mutual understanding that the sharing of such material is not intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or its continued protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege. All Confidential Information provided by a party that is entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege shall remain entitled to such protection under these privileges, this Agreement, and under the joint defense doctrine. Nothing in this Agreement obligates any party to reveal material subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege.\n9. Upon the Disclosing Party\u2019s written request, the Receiving Party shall (at the Receiving Party\u2019s election) promptly return or destroy (provided that any such destruction shall be certified by a duly authorized Representative of the Receiving Party) all Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party and all copies, reproductions, summaries, analyses or extracts thereof or based thereon (whether in hard-copy form or an intangible media, such as electronic mail or computer files) in the Receiving Party\u2019s possession or in the possession of any Representative of the Receiving Party; provided, however: (i) that if a legal proceeding has been instituted to seek disclosure of the Confidential Information, such material shall not be destroyed until the proceeding is settled or a final judgment with respect thereto has been rendered; (ii) that the Receiving Party shall not, in connection with the foregoing obligations, be required to identify or delete Confidential Information held electronically in archive or back-up systems in accordance with general systems archiving or backup policies; and (iii) that the Receiving Party shall not be obligated to return or destroy Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to the extent the Receiving Party is required to retain a copy pursuant to applicable law, and further provided that the Receiving Party will not, and the Receiving Party will use reasonable measures to cause its employees not to, access such Confidential Information so archived or backed-up.\n10. Each Party hereto acknowledges that neither it nor its Representatives nor any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons of such Representatives makes any express or implied representation or warranty as to the completeness of the Confidential Information.\n11. Until a separate definitive agreement regarding a potential relationship or transaction has been executed by the parties, neither party shall be under any legal obligation or have any liability to the other party of any nature whatsoever with respect to any proposal, term sheet, letter of intent, or draft agreement relating to any such potential relationship or transaction (other than with respect to the confidentiality and other matters set forth herein). Each party hereto and its Representatives (a) may conduct the process that may or may not result in definitive agreement in such manner as such party, in its sole discretion, may determine (including, without limitation, negotiating and entering into a definitive agreement with any third party without notice to the other party); and (b) reserves the right to change (in its sole discretion, at any time and without notice to the other party) the procedures relating to the parties\u2019 consideration of the potential relationship or transaction (including, without limitation, terminating all further discussions with the other party and requesting that the other party return or destroy the Confidential Information as described above). Either party can end the discussions at any time, for any reason, and without liability to the other. Any business decision either party makes in anticipation of definitive agreements is at the sore risk of the party making the decision, even if the other party is aware of or has indicated approval of, such decision.\n12. Each party is aware, and will advise its Representatives who are informed of the matters that are the subject of this Agreement, of the restrictions imposed by the United States securities laws on the purchase or sale of securities by any person who has received material, non-public information from the issuer of such securities and on the communication of such information to any other person when it is reasonably foreseeable that such other person is likely to purchase or sell such securities in reliance upon such information.\n13. In consideration of the Information being furnished to SAP and the Company, each of SAP and the Company hereby agree that, until twelve (12) months after the date of termination of this Agreement, such party will not solicit for employment with such party or any of its subsidiaries, or employ, any of the current officers or employees of the other party with whom such party has had contact during the term of this Agreement and who became known by such party or who was identified to such party as part of the Evaluation under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall restrict or preclude either party from (A) making generalized searches for employees (by use of advertisements in the media, the engagement of search firms or otherwise), (B) continuing its ordinary course hiring practices that are not targeted specifically at employees of the other party or (C) hiring an employee of the other party who first initiates an employment discussion with such party, so long as such party has not violated the restrictions on solicitation contained in this Agreement.\n14. In consideration of the Confidential Information being provided to a Receiving Party for purposes of the Evaluation, the parties agree that until one (1) year after the date of termination of this Agreement, neither party nor any of each party\u2019s affiliates or its Representatives acting on the party\u2019s behalf will, unless specifically invited in writing by the other party\u2019s Board of Directors or its duly authorized representative: (i) acquire, offer to acquire, or agree to acquire, directly or indirectly, by purchase or otherwise, any voting securities or direct or indirect rights to acquire any voting securities, or indebtedness of the other party or any subsidiary thereof, or any successor entity; (ii) make, directly or indirectly, any \u201csolicitation\u201d of \u201cproxies\u201d (as such terms are used in Rule 14a-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201c34 Act\u201d)) to vote, or seek to advise or influence any person or entity with respect to the voting of, any voting securities of the other party; (iii) make any public announcement with respect to, or submit a proposal for, or offer of any merger, consolidation, stock purchase tender or exchange offer, restructuring or business combination, involving the other party or to purchase, directly or indirectly, a material portion of the assets of the other party or its subsidiaries; (iv) form, join or in any way participate in a \u201cgroup\u201d (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the 34 Act) in connection with any of the foregoing; (v) request the other party or any of the other party\u2019s Representatives to amend or waive any provisions of this paragraph in a manner that would require public disclosure of such request; or (vi) take any action that could reasonably be expected to require the other party to make a public announcement regarding the possibility of any of the events described in sub-clauses (i) through (v). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph, (1) each party shall be permitted at any time and from time to time to submit to the Chief Executive Officer of the other party one or more offers, proposals or indications of interest related to a transaction between the parties, provided that each such submission is made on a confidential basis and states that the provider does not intend to make a public announcement related to such submission or its text or contents and that the provider of such submission believes, after discussion with its counsel, that the receipt thereof by the other party does not require public disclosure of such submission and (2) no party shall be bound by the foregoing restrictions in the event that any person or \u201cgroup\u201d (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the 34 Act) other than such party or its affiliates shall (x) acquire or publicly propose to acquire, by purchase, merger, tender offer, reorganization, consolidation or otherwise, beneficial ownership of more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the other party or assets of the other party or its subsidiaries representing more than 50% of the consolidated earning power of the other party and its subsidiaries and the other party\u2019s Board of Directors has recommended to such other party\u2019s shareholders that such acquisition be approved or (y) enter into an agreement or publicly propose to enter into an agreement providing for the merger or consolidation, or any similar transaction, involving the other party in which, following consummation of such transaction, substantially all of the persons or entities who, immediately prior to such transaction, had beneficial ownership of 50% or more of the voting power of the other party would not continue to beneficially own by virtue of their exchange or retention of securities of such other party representing at least 50% of the voting power of the combined entity and would not have the ability to elect a majority of the directors of the combined entity and the other party\u2019s Board of Directors has recommended to such other party\u2019s shareholders that such merger, consolidation or similar transaction be approved.\n15. Without prejudice to the rights and remedies otherwise available to either party hereto, each party hereto shall be entitled to equitable relief by way of injunction or otherwise if the other party or any of its Representatives breach or threaten to breach any of the provisions of this Agreement.\n16. The Receiving Party acknowledges that neither the Disclosing Party nor its Representatives nor any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons of such Representatives makes any express or implied representation or warranty regarding the Confidential Information, including, without limitation, any representation or warranty as to the completeness or accuracy of the Confidential Information.\n17. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, United States of America, without giving effect to its principles or rules regarding conflicts of laws, other than such principles directing application of New York law. The parties agree the courts of the State of California shall be the exclusive venue for disputes arising under this Agreement. In the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, the remaining portions hereof shall remain in full force and effect.\n18. This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the parties hereto as to Confidential Information disclosed hereunder in connection with the Evaluation and merges all prior discussions between them relating thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the parties have entered into, or enter into in the future, other agreements which contain terms concerning ownership or use of work product of either party or software license provisions and rights, then this Agreement shall not supersede either party\u2019s rights and obligations as provided in such other agreements, unless such other agreement specifically provides otherwise. Neither Party will assign or transfer any rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party. No amendment or modification of this Agreement shall be valid or binding on the parties unless made in writing and signed on behalf of each of the parties by their respective duly authorized officers or representatives. Any waiver of a provision of this Agreement shall not be deemed a subsequent waiver of the same or any other provision of this Agreement. It is further understood and agreed that no failure or delay by either party hereto in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder.\n19. The term of this Agreement shall be one (1) year beginning with the Effective Date, unless terminated earlier by either party at such party\u2019s sole discretion upon thirty (30) days written notice to the other party. The provisions herein concerning the disclosure, protection and use of Confidential Information, including Sections 3, 4, 7 and 9, shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement. The non-solicit and standstill obligations shall remain in effect as provided in Sections 13 or 14, as applicable.\nThis Agreement may be executed in counterparts or by facsimile, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which together shall constitute one and the same agreement.\n",

(the \u201cRecipient\u201d).\n WHEREAS, CEDC has issued (i) 3.00% Convertible Notes due 2013 (the \u201cConvertible Notes\u201d) and (ii) $380 million 9.125% Senior Secured Notes due 2016 and \u20ac430 ($556.6 million) 8.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2016 (collectively, the \u201c2016 Notes\u201d and together with the Convertible Notes, the \u201cNotes\u201d).\n WHEREAS, the Recipient holds 7,517,549 shares of CEDC\u2019s outstanding common stock (the \u201cCommon Stock\u201d).\n WHEREAS the Recipient and CEDC wish to enter into discussions with respect to a potential restructuring of the Notes and Common Stock (a \u201cRestructuring\u201d).\nWHEREAS, CEDC, in such discussions, may disclose certain confidential information to the Recipient in order to initiate, facilitate, and/or progress such restructuring discussions (the \u201cPurpose\u201d).\nNOW THEREFORE, in consideration for receiving certain confidential information and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:\n1. Scope of Confidential Information.\n1.1 Subject to Section 1.2 below, \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means confidential, secret, proprietary or other non-public information pertaining to the business, operations, brands, marketing plans, financial matters, legal matters, products, projects, business plans or practices, research and development, product development, intellectual property, financial models, trademarks, trade secrets, accounting and financing data, and methods of production, distribution or procurement, suppliers, distributors, consultants, advisors or employees, directors or officers of CEDC or any of its Subsidiaries (defined below) (together, the \u201cCEDC Group\u201d) that is disclosed or otherwise made available, either orally or in writing, by any member of the CEDC Group to the Recipient or its affiliates, agents, or advisors (including, without limitation, financial advisors, attorneys, banks and other sources of equity and debt financing and accountants) (collectively, \u201cRepresentatives\u201d).\n1.2 Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Confidential Information shall not include any information that (a) is or becomes publicly available (other than through a breach of this Agreement by the Recipient), (b) is in the possession of or known to the Recipient or its Representatives prior to such information having been furnished to Recipient hereunder, (c) is independently conceived, developed or discovered by the Recipient or on its behalf, (d) is made available to the Recipient or its Representatives by any person other than a member of the CEDC Group without any known breach of any obligation of confidentiality of such other person, or (e) is the subject of a written confirmation from CEDC or any of its Subsidiaries or any member of the CEDC Group stating that any such information is not Confidential Information. In clarification of the foregoing, a general disclosure in the public domain will not cause more specific (but related) information to be excluded as Confidential Information under one of the above exceptions.\n1.3 \u201cSubsidiary\u201d of any entity means any other entity in which such first entity owns or Controls, directly or indirectly, an amount of the voting securities, other voting interests or voting partnership interests sufficient to elect at least a majority of such other entity\u2019s board of directors or other governing body (or, if there are no such voting interests, 50% or more of the equity interests of such other entity). For purposes of this Section 1.3, \u201cControl\u201d means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of an individual, corporation, partnership, limited partnership or limited liability company, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.\n2. Use and Disclosure of Confidential Information.\n2.1 The Recipient agrees that all Confidential Information will be held and maintained by it in the strictest confidence, will be used by it solely and exclusively for the purpose of evaluating, negotiating and implementing a Restructuring, and will not, directly or indirectly, be used or disclosed by it for any other purpose whatsoever. CEDC acknowledges that Recipient is engaged in businesses similar to those conducted by CEDC and the CEDC Group or other industries in the ordinary course of Recipient\u2019s business. The Recipient will use reasonable care to maintain the confidentiality of Confidential Information, provided that such care shall be at least as great as the precautions taken by the Recipient to protect its own confidential information of similar nature.\n2.2 The Recipient agrees that it will not, without the prior written consent of CEDC, directly or indirectly, disclose all or any portion of the Confidential Information, or the substance thereof, to any third party other than its Representatives in connection with the Purpose, except, subject to Section 2.3 below, to the extent required by applicable law or legal process.\n2.3 The Recipient agrees that if the Recipient is required by any law, court or governmental order to disclose any Confidential Information, the Recipient will provide CEDC, to the extent practicable and legally permissible, with prompt written notice of such requirement so that CEDC or the applicable member of the CEDC Group may seek an appropriate protective order with respect thereto. If such an order is not obtained, only that portion of the Confidential Information shall be furnished that is legally required to be furnished, at the sole expense of CEDC or one of its Subsidiaries, and the Recipient shall exercise commercial efforts to obtain reliable assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded such Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, notice to CEDC shall not be required where disclosure is made (i) in response to a request by a regulatory or self-regulatory authority, or (ii) in connection with a routine audit or examination by a bank examiner or auditor, and such request, audit or examination does not reference CEDC or this Agreement.\n2.4 The Recipient shall ensure that each of its Representatives who are either provided with Confidential Information, or otherwise have access to such Confidential Information, are informed of its confidential nature and are directed to abide by the terms of this Agreement applicable to Representatives or appropriate duties or obligations of confidentiality imposing confidentiality obligations on such Representatives (except that there shall be no requirement to so inform where the Representative to whom the information is to be disclosed is subject to professional obligations to maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information or is otherwise bound by requirements of confidentiality in relation to the Confidential Information). The Recipient agrees to be liable for any breach of this Agreement by the Recipient or its affiliates or Representatives. The Recipient shall use reasonable efforts to provide written notice to CEDC of any use or disclosure of Confidential Information in breach of this Agreement of which Recipient is aware, including without limitation written details regarding the circumstances and the identity of the individuals or entities who as a result received or may have received access to such Confidential Information.\n3. Certain Rights and Limitations.\n3.1 The parties hereto are independent of one another and this Agreement does not create any agency, partnership or similar relationship between the parties hereto. CEDC acknowledges that neither the Recipient nor any of its affiliates, nor its or their Representatives, will be deemed to have made any representation or warranty or commitment with respect to the Purpose except as may be set forth in one or more final, legally binding definitive agreements. Except as otherwise provided by CEDC, the Recipient (i) acknowledges that neither CEDC nor any of its Representatives make any representation or warranty hereunder, either express or implied, as to the truth, accuracy or completeness of any Confidential Information, provided, however, that CEDC, the CEDC Group and any of their Representatives shall use good faith efforts to ensure that all Confidential Information furnished to Recipient hereunder is true, accurate and complete to the best of their knowledge, and (ii) agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by law that in the absence of fraud or willful misconduct on their part neither CEDC nor any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives shall have any liability to the Recipient or its Representatives on any basis (including, without limitation, in contract, tort, under federal or state securities laws or otherwise) as a result of the review by the Recipient or its Representatives or the use of the Confidential Information by the Recipient or its Representatives in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.\n3.2 The Recipient agrees that, upon written request by CEDC, all Confidential Information (and all copies, summaries and notes of the contents or parts thereof) and all Company property received by the Recipient shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, be either returned to CEDC or, to the extent technically practicable, destroyed (at the Recipient\u2019s or its Representatives\u2019 option), except that Recipient and its Representatives may retain copies of Confidential Information as is required to comply with applicable law or regulation or professional standards or internal compliance requirements. The Recipient\u2019s obligations under Section 2 hereof shall survive the return of such tangible embodiments of Confidential Information until termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither Recipient nor any of its Representatives shall be required to delete electronically stored Confidential Information to the extent such deletion would be technologically impracticable or inconsistent with the archival records retention policy of the Recipient or its Representatives.\n3.3 The Recipient shall not remove, obscure, overprint, deface or destroy any notice of confidentiality, copyright, trademark, logo, legend or other notices of ownership or confidentiality from any originals or copies of Confidential Information the Recipient obtains from the CEDC Group.\n3.4 CEDC understands and acknowledges that the Recipient and an affiliate of the Recipient are currently reporting persons with respect to CEDC\u2019s common stock on a Schedule 13D under the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 240.13d-1(a) and 13d-2(a) of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, among others, and that accordingly the Recipient and its affiliate will have ongoing disclosure obligations thereunder, which shall not be restricted or limited by this Agreement, including that this Agreement shall be disclosed and publicly filed as an amendment to such Schedule 13D.\n4. Remedies. The Recipient acknowledges that a breach of any of the terms of this Agreement may cause irreparable harm to CEDC for which CEDC may not be adequately compensated by money damages. Accordingly, the Recipient agrees that, in addition to all other remedies available to CEDC, including any member of the CEDC Group, in an action at law, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by the Recipient of the terms of this Agreement, CEDC shall, without the necessity of proving actual damages or posting any bond or other security, be entitled to seek temporary and permanent injunctive relief, including, but not limited to, specific performance of the terms of this Agreement. Each party's rights and obligations under this Agreement are cumulative and are in addition to and not in limitation of such party's rights and obligations under law, equity or any other written agreement.\n5. Miscellaneous.\n5.1 This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and take effect as an enforceable contract in accordance with the laws of the State of New York governing such agreements, without regard to conflicts-of-law principles thereof that would require applicability of any other law. The parties hereto agree that any dispute between them relating to this Agreement will be resolved solely in the manner set forth in clause (i) below:\n(i) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court located in the State of New York and in the Borough of Manhattan, and all appellate courts relating thereto, for the purpose of any suit, action, proceeding or judgment relating to or arising out of this Agreement. Service of process in connection with any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on each party hereto anywhere in the world by the same methods as are specified for the giving of notices under this Agreement. Each party hereto irrevocably waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such courts and irrevocably waives any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO REQUEST A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LITIGATION WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT AND REPRESENTS THAT COUNSEL HAS BEEN CONSULTED SPECIFICALLY AS TO THIS WAIVER.\n5.2 Any notices or other correspondence (hereinafter collectively referred to as \u201ccorrespondence\u201d) required or permitted to be given hereunder shall be in writing and shall be sent by postage prepaid first class mail, courier or facsimile or delivered by hand to the party to whom such correspondence is required or permitted to be given hereunder, and shall be deemed sufficient upon receipt when delivered personally or by courier, overnight delivery service or confirmed facsimile, or three (3) Business Days after being deposited in the regular mail as certified or registered mail (airmail if sent internationally) with postage prepaid, if such notice is addressed to the party to be notified at such party\u2019s address or facsimile number as set forth below:\n(a) All correspondence to the CEDC Group shall be addressed as follows:\nCentral European Distribution Corporation\nBobrowiecka 6\n00-728 Warsaw\nPoland\nAttention: Grant Winterton\nFacsimile: +48 22 456 60 01\nwith a copy to\nSkadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom (UK) LLP\n40 Bank St., Canary Wharf\nLondon E14 5DS UK\nAttention: Scott Simpson, Esq.\nFacsimile: +44 20 7519 7070\n(b) All correspondence to the Recipient shall be addressed as follows:\nW&L Enterprises Ltd.\nCraigmuir Chambers,\nP.O.

This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties, and their respective successors and permitted assigns, including without limitation the heirs, executors and legal representatives of each such party. The Recipient acknowledges and agrees that all members of the CEDC Group are third party beneficiaries of this Agreement. Except where expressly indicated otherwise, the words \u201cwritten\u201d or \u201cin writing\u201d shall include, but not be limited to, written or printed documents, electronic and facsimile transmissions and computer disks or tapes (whether machine or user readable). If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Upon such determination of invalidity or unenforceability, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a reasonably acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible. No amendment, modification or alteration of the terms of this Agreement shall be effective unless made in writing and executed by both parties hereto. A failure or delay in exercising any right in respect to this Agreement will not be presumed to operate as a waiver, and a single or partial exercise of any right will not be presumed to preclude any subsequent or further exercise of that right or the exercise of any other right. Any such waiver shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose given. This Agreement may be signed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original for all purposes.\n6. Securities Laws. The Recipient acknowledges that it is aware (and, if applicable, that its Representatives who are apprised of this matter have been advised) that the United States securities laws prohibit any person who has material non-public information about a company from purchasing or selling securities of such company, or from communicating such information to any other person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person is likely to purchase or sell such securities. The Recipient agrees that, to the extent that it has actually received Confidential Information pursuant to this Agreement that constitutes material non-public information, it will not trade any securities of CEDC or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the termination of this Agreement and that it will not use any Confidential Information in contravention of the United States securities laws.\n7. Termination.\n7.1 The provisions of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect at all times until the earliest to occur of (i) the filing of an exchange offer, offering memorandum or disclosure statement with respect to the 2016 Notes or Convertible Notes, provided that, to the extent CEDC and the Recipient continue discussions on the terms of a Restructuring following such filing, this period shall extend until the filing of an amended exchange offer, offering memorandum or disclosure statement reflecting such discussions or (ii) 9:00 a.m. (GMT) on March 5, 2013, whereupon this Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or effect (the \u201cTermination Date\u201d), other than with respect to the rights and obligations of CEDC and Recipient per Section 7.2 hereof.\n7.2 On the Termination Date, CEDC shall publicly file a document (the \u201cCleansing Document\u201d) containing all of the written and oral Confidential Information that constitutes material non-public information and that was provided by CEDC or its advisors to any of (a) the Recipient or its Representatives or (b) any holder of securities who is subject to a confidentiality agreement substantially similar to this Agreement (or to such holder\u2019s Representatives) that was subsequently shared with the Recipient or its Representatives; provided that such Confidential Information shall not include any information only disclosed to the Recipients' advisors and specifically designated as \u2018Non-Cleansing Information\u2019 by CEDC at the time of such disclosure (such Confidential Information other than the \u2018Non-Cleansing Information\u2019 being the \u201cDisclosure Information\u201d). As promptly as practicable, CEDC will provide the Recipient with a draft of the Cleansing Document. The Cleansing Document shall be the offering memorandum and/or disclosure statement and/or Form 8-K or any periodic report required or permitted to be filed under the Exchange Act with the Securities Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) or, if the SEC\u2019s EDGAR filing system is not available, in such other manner that CEDC reasonably determines results in public dissemination of such information. If CEDC does not file the Cleansing Document on the Termination Date as required in accordance with this Section 7.2, then Recipient and/or its Representatives shall be entitled to disclose the Confidential Information that was provided by CEDC or any of its Subsidiaries hereunder without liability to the extent that Recipient or its Representatives reasonably believes that the information constitutes material non-public information that is required to allow it to freely trade, through the issuance of a press release or similar form of public communication, without any liability or breach under this Agreement (such an announcement, the \u201cRecipient\u2019s Cleansing Announcement\u201d). For the avoidance of doubt, if the Cleansing Document filed by CEDC pursuant hereto is not in sufficient detail to ensure that, in the reasonable opinion of each of the Recipients or their Representatives, the Recipients and their Representatives will be cleansed of any Confidential Information hereunder such that, following the filing of the Cleansing Document by CEDC, no Recipient shall be restricted, prevented or prohibited from trading any securities under applicable insider dealing or market abuse laws or regulations in any jurisdiction or pursuant to any other applicable laws or regulations, then the Recipients may make a Recipient\u2019s Cleansing Announcement in the manner set forth above in this Section 7.2.\n[Signatures on the Following Page ]\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement is executed by the undersigned parties.
